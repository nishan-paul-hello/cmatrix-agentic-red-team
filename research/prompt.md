### Folder Rules:
- **`artifacts/`** — One `.md` file per sub-step. Filename pattern: `step-{number}{letter}-{short-description}` in lowercase kebab-case. Example: `step-1a-codebase-read.md`, `step-3b-core-contributions.md`
- **`assets/`** — All figures and tables as individual `.tex` files. Figures: `figure-{index}-{name}.tex`. Tables: `table-{index}-{name}.tex`. Also contains `equations.tex`, `references.bib`, and `ASSET-INDEX.md`
- **`sections/`** — One `.tex` file per paper section in lowercase kebab-case. Example: `introduction.tex`, `related-work.tex`, `threat-model.tex`
- **`main/main.tex`** — Master LaTeX file. References all sections via `\input{../sections/...}` and all assets via `\input{../assets/...}`. Uses `IEEEtran.cls` and `IEEEtran.bst` already present in `main/`

---

## CORE OPERATING RULES

- **Before every sub-step**, read `artifacts/research-area.md` first. This file defines the research context and must inform all decisions.
- Work in **strict modular sub-steps**. Complete one sub-step, create its artifact, run its checklist, then pause. Do NOT proceed until explicitly confirmed.
- **After every sub-step**, you must: (1) create a structured artifact `.md` file in `artifacts/`, (2) run the sub-step's full checklist against that artifact, (3) report checklist results, (4) then pause and await confirmation.
- **Every subsequent sub-step must begin by reading the previous sub-step's artifact** from `artifacts/` as its primary input. Never rely on conversation memory alone.
- **Default to bullet points and structured output** over prose unless writing the actual paper draft.
- Be **aggressive about quality** — rewrite, restructure, or discard anything that weakens the paper. No attachment to existing drafts.
- When uncertain about a claim, **search and verify**. Do not hallucinate citations or data.
- **Token limit rule:** Never generate more than one sub-step per response. If a sub-step is still too long, split it (e.g., 3a-i, 3a-ii), pause between splits, and label clearly where you stopped and what comes next.
- If a checklist item fails, **fix it before reporting completion**. Never mark a step done with failing checklist items.
- **No placeholder content ever.** Every figure, table, equation, and section must contain real, specific content derived from the actual research. Never write `[INSERT FIGURE HERE]`, `[PLACEHOLDER]`, `TBD`, or any equivalent. If content cannot be generated yet, flag it explicitly as a blocking issue.

---

## ARTIFACT PROTOCOL

After every sub-step, create a `.md` file in `artifacts/` following this naming pattern:
**`step-{number}{letter}-{short-description}.md`**

Examples:
- `step-1a-codebase-read.md`
- `step-2c-related-work-map.md`
- `step-3b-core-contributions.md`

Each artifact file must contain:

```markdown
# [STEP Xa] — [Sub-step Name]

## Summary
What was done in this sub-step (2–3 sentences).

## Full Output
All structured content produced.

## Key Decisions Made
Any judgment calls or choices made and why.

## Open Questions
Anything uncertain or unresolved that the next step should address.

## Checklist Results
- [PASS/FAIL] Checklist item 1
- [PASS/FAIL] Checklist item 2
...

## Asset Files Created
List of all files created in assets/ or sections/ this sub-step, with filename and description.

## Input for Next Step
A clear, concise brief that the next sub-step will use as its starting point.
```

---

## ASSET FILE PROTOCOL

Every figure and table must be saved as a **separate LaTeX file** in `assets/`.

### Naming Convention:
- Figures: `assets/figure-{index}-{short-descriptive-name}.tex`
- Tables: `assets/table-{index}-{short-descriptive-name}.tex`

Examples: `assets/figure-01-system-architecture.tex`, `assets/table-01-related-work-comparison.tex`

### Each Figure File Must Contain:
```latex
% ============================================================
% FIGURE {INDEX}: {FULL TITLE}
% File: assets/figure-{index}-{name}.tex
% Section: {section where this figure appears}
% Description: {what this figure shows and why it matters}
% ============================================================

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[...]
    % FULL TikZ code — no placeholders
    % Every node, edge, label, color explicitly defined
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Full descriptive caption explaining what the figure shows
           and what insight the reader should take away.}
  \label{fig:{short-name}}
\end{figure}
```

### Each Table File Must Contain:
```latex
% ============================================================
% TABLE {INDEX}: {FULL TITLE}
% File: assets/table-{index}-{name}.tex
% Section: {section where this table appears}
% Description: {what this table shows and why it matters}
% ============================================================

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Full descriptive caption.}
  \label{tab:{short-name}}
  \begin{tabular}{...}
    \toprule
    % FULL table content — real data, real values, no placeholders
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

### Main Paper References Assets Via `\input{}`:
```latex
% In main/main.tex or in sections/*.tex:
\input{../assets/figure-01-system-architecture}
\input{../assets/table-01-related-work-comparison}
```

### Asset Index File:
Maintain `assets/ASSET-INDEX.md` updated after every sub-step:

```markdown
# Asset Index

## Figures
| Index | Filename | Title | Section | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 01 | figure-01-threat-model.tex | Threat Model Diagram | §3 Threat Model | COMPLETE |

## Tables
| Index | Filename | Title | Section | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 01 | table-01-related-work-comparison.tex | Related Work Comparison | §2 Related Work | COMPLETE |
```

---

## SECTION FILE PROTOCOL

Every paper section must be saved as a **separate `.tex` file** in `sections/` in lowercase kebab-case.

### Naming Convention:
- `sections/abstract.tex`
- `sections/introduction.tex`
- `sections/background.tex`
- `sections/related-work.tex`
- `sections/threat-model.tex`
- `sections/methodology.tex`
- `sections/evaluation.tex`
- `sections/discussion.tex`
- `sections/limitations.tex`
- `sections/conclusion.tex`
- `sections/references.bib` ← BibTeX file (already exists, update it)

### Main File References Sections:
```latex
% main/main.tex
\documentclass[conference]{../main/IEEEtran}
\bibliographystyle{../main/IEEEtran}
...
\input{../sections/abstract}
\input{../sections/introduction}
\input{../sections/background}
\input{../sections/related-work}
\input{../sections/threat-model}

## LATEX QUALITY RULES

- Use **TikZ** for all diagrams, flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and attack flows
- Use **pgfplots** for all graphs, bar charts, line charts, and performance plots
- Use **booktabs** (`\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`) for all tables — never `\hline`
- Use **algorithm2e** or **algorithmicx** for all pseudocode
- All figures must use `\label{}` and be referenced via `\ref{}` in section files
- All tables must use `\label{}` and be referenced via `\ref{}` in section files
- Color schemes must be colorblind-safe: `blue!70`, `red!60`, `green!50!black`, `orange!80`, `gray!40`
- Every TikZ diagram must define styles at the top of the `tikzpicture` block
- Font sizes inside figures: use `\small` or `\footnotesize`
- All axis labels, node labels, and legend entries must be explicitly set

### STEP 6 — Full Paper Drafting

**Draft one section at a time. After each section, pause and await confirmation.**
**Every section file in `sections/` references assets via `\input{../assets/...}` — never inline figures or tables.**
**No placeholders. Every referenced figure, table, and equation must already exist in `assets/`.**

## QUALITY BAR

This paper must be submittable to **IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, or ACM CCS** without embarrassment. If it isn't at that level, keep working.

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

Stop immediately and flag if any of the following occur:

- `artifacts/research-area.md` cannot be read at the start of a sub-step
- A checklist item cannot be completed due to missing information
- A novelty claim cannot be grounded in the literature
- A result referenced in the paper does not exist in the codebase or data
- A citation cannot be verified online
- The paper's story becomes internally inconsistent
- Any asset file cannot be generated without placeholder content
- Any `\input{}`, `\ref{}`, or `\cite{}` key cannot be resolved
- A section file or asset file cannot be written to its correct folder location

---

**Begin with STEP 1a. Read `artifacts/research-area.md` first. Create `artifacts/step-1a-codebase-read.md`. Run the checklist. Report results. Then stop and await confirmation.**
