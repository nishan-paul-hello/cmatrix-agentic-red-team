# [STEP 6f] — Discussion & Limitations — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step finalized the Discussion and Limitations sections (§6) of the manuscript. We moved beyond simple data reporting to interpret the results in the context of the core contributions. We highlighted the synergy between planning and reflection, the scaling laws of agentic efficiency, and the success of the "Governed Autonomy" model. We also provided an honest assessment of current limitations regarding reasoning depth and static risk policies.

## 2) Full Output

### 2.1 Finalized Discussion Insights (§6.1 - 6.3)
- **Synergy of Patterns**: Analyzed why ReWOO (efficiency) and Reflexion (reliability) are mutually necessary for operational security.
- **Scaling Laws**: Interpreted the 2.42x TE gain as a mechanism to "flatten the cost-cliff" for long-horizon attack chains.
- **Governed Autonomy**: Validated the HITL safety gate as a "Performance Enabler" that provides the trust boundary necessary for production deployment.

### 2.2 Finalized Limitations & Future Work (§6.4)
1. **Context Pollution**: Reasoning degradation beyond 12-15 steps. *Future Work*: Hierarchical context pruning.
2. **Static Risk**: Limitations of the `approval_config.py` model. *Future Work*: Dynamic, environment-aware risk assessment.
3. **Exploit Generation**: Constraints on 0-day discovery. *Future Work*: Integration of symbolic execution worker agents.

## 3) Key Decisions Made
- **Avoidance of Overclaiming**: Explicitly stated that CMatrix is still constrained by the underlying LLM's binary exploit generation capabilities, ensuring the paper remains defensible at top-tier security venues.
- **"Governed Autonomy" Terminology**: Coined this term to describe our contribution #3, providing a punchy conceptual hook for the conclusion.
- **Link to Contributions**: Ensured that each discussion subsection directly validates one or more of the 4 core contributions from 3b.

## 4) Open Questions
- **Hierarchy of Agents**: Should the discussion mention the potential for agents to "spawn" sub-agents as a way to handle context pollution? (Decision: Relegated to the "Future Work" section).

## 5) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] Every contribution from 3b (Composite Reasoning, Executable Reflection, HITL Safety, Empirical Study) validated in the discussion
- [PASS] Limitations are honest and specific (Context pollution, static risk, exploit limits)
- [PASS] 3 concrete future work directions provided
- [PASS] Discussion interprets results (explains the "why" behind the 2.42x gain)
- [PASS] No overclaiming — specifically addressed LLM reasoning limits
- [PASS] No placeholder text anywhere

## 6) Input for Next Step (Step 6g)
- **Closure**: Step 6g (Conclusion) will synthesize the "Governed Autonomy" and "Reasoning Synergy" points into the final summary statement.
- **Broader Impact**: Frame the final impact around the "Trustworthy and Scalable Autonomous Security" vision.
