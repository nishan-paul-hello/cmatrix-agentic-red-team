## SECTION 3 — NETWORK PENTESTING
*The VAPT agent papers focused on network infrastructure: reconnaissance, service exploitation, CVE chaining, lateral movement, shell acquisition. This is where all prior LLM-agent VAPT research has concentrated — CMatrix builds on and differentiates from all of these.*

## SECTION 4 — MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATIONS
*Justify your orchestration design choices.*

| # | File | Paper | Unique Contribution |

## SECTION 5 — AGENT REASONING FOUNDATIONS
*Papers whose mechanisms are directly implemented inside CMatrix's agent architecture.*

| # | File | Paper | Venue | Maps To CMatrix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | [📄 `21-voyager-an-open-ended-embodied-agent.pdf`](paper-research/downloaded-paper-curated/21-voyager-an-open-ended-embodied-agent.pdf) | **Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models** — Wang et al. (NVIDIA/Stanford/UT Austin), 2023 | **NeurIPS 2023** | **Attack Strategy Library** (§6, C11): Voyager's persistent, ever-growing skill library — where completed tasks are crystallized into reusable code skills stored in a vector DB and retrieved at task-start — is the direct conceptual ancestor of CMatrix's technology-fingerprint-indexed attack strategy crystallization. CMatrix domain-constrains the mechanism to security exploitation procedures with confidence scoring. |
| 22 | [📄 `22-reflexion-language-agents-with-verbal-rl.pdf`](paper-research/downloaded-paper-curated/22-reflexion-language-agents-with-verbal-rl.pdf) | **Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning** — Shinn et al. (Northeastern/Princeton), 2023 | **NeurIPS 2023** | **Validation Agent self-debugging loop** (§6: diagnose→contextualize→adapt→retry→cap) + **Cycle Guard/Reflector** (§10): both are direct implementations of Reflexion's verbal reinforcement pattern — the agent critiques its own failed attempts, stores the reflection, and adapts before retrying. Every agent paper cites this; not listing it as primary when two contributions implement it looks like an oversight. |
