## 🚀 Abstract

We introduce **VOYAGER**, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that continuously explores the world, acquires diverse skills, and makes novel discoveries without human intervention. 

VOYAGER consists of three key components:
1. An **automatic curriculum** that maximizes exploration.
2. An **ever-growing skill library** of executable code for storing and retrieving complex behaviors.
3. A **new iterative prompting mechanism** that incorporates environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification for program improvement.

> 💡 **Key Insight**
>
> VOYAGER interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses the need for model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by VOYAGER are temporally extended, interpretable, and compositional, which compounds the agent's abilities rapidly and alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

**Empirically**, VOYAGER shows strong in-context lifelong learning capability and exhibits exceptional proficiency in playing Minecraft. It obtains **3.3x more unique items**, travels **2.3× longer distances**, and unlocks key tech tree milestones up to **15.3× faster** than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA). VOYAGER is able to utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks from scratch, while other techniques struggle to generalize.

## 1. Introduction

Building generally capable embodied agents that continuously explore, plan, and develop new skills in open-ended worlds is a grand challenge for the AI community [1–5]. Classical approaches employ reinforcement learning (RL) [6, 7] and imitation learning [8–10] that operate on primitive actions, which could be challenging for systematic exploration [11–15], interpretability [16–18], and generalization [19–21]. 

Recent advances in large language model (LLM) based agents harness the world knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained LLMs to generate consistent action plans or executable policies [16, 22, 19]. They are applied to embodied tasks like games and robotics [23–27], as well as NLP tasks without embodiment [28–30]. However, these agents are not lifelong learners that can progressively acquire, update, accumulate, and transfer knowledge over extended time spans [31, 32].

### 🎮 The Minecraft Challenge

Let us consider Minecraft as an example. Unlike most other games studied in AI [33, 34, 10], Minecraft does not impose a predefined end goal or a fixed storyline but rather provides a unique playground with endless possibilities [23]. Minecraft requires players to explore vast, procedurally generated 3D terrains and unlock a tech tree using gathered resources. Human players typically start by learning the basics, such as mining wood and cooking food, before advancing to more complex tasks like combating monsters and crafting diamond tools. 

We argue that an effective lifelong learning agent should have similar capabilities as human players:

1. **Propose suitable tasks** based on its current skill level and world state (e.g., learn to harvest sand and cactus before iron if it finds itself in a desert rather than a forest).
2. **Refine skills** based on environmental feedback and commit mastered skills to memory for future reuse in similar situations (e.g., fighting zombies is similar to fighting spiders).
3. **Continually explore** the world and seek out new tasks in a self-driven manner.

*Figure 2: VOYAGER consists of three key components: an automatic curriculum for open-ended exploration, a skill library for increasingly complex behaviors, and an iterative prompting mechanism that uses code as action space.*

### 🎯 VOYAGER's Approach

Towards these goals, we introduce **VOYAGER**, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent to drive exploration, master a wide range of skills, and make new discoveries continually without human intervention in Minecraft. VOYAGER is made possible through three key modules:

* 🗺️ **Automatic curriculum** that maximizes exploration.
* 📚 **Skill library** for storing and retrieving complex behaviors.
* 🔄 **Iterative prompting mechanism** that generates executable code for embodied control.

> 📌 **Remember**
>
> We opt to use **code as the action space** instead of low-level motor commands because programs can naturally represent temporally extended and compositional actions [16, 22], which are essential for many long-horizon tasks in Minecraft. VOYAGER interacts with a blackbox LLM (GPT-4 [35]) through prompting and in-context learning [36–38]. Our approach bypasses the need for model parameter access and explicit gradient-based training or finetuning.

More specifically, VOYAGER attempts to solve progressively harder tasks proposed by the automatic curriculum, which takes into account the exploration progress and the agent's state. The curriculum is generated by GPT-4 based on the overarching goal of *"discovering as many diverse things as possible"*. This approach can be perceived as an in-context form of novelty search [39, 40]. 

VOYAGER incrementally builds a skill library by storing the action programs that help solve a task successfully. Each program is indexed by the embedding of its description, which can be retrieved in similar situations in the future. Complex skills can be synthesized by composing simpler programs, which compounds VOYAGER's capabilities rapidly over time and alleviates catastrophic forgetting in other continual learning methods [31, 32].

### 🛠️ Overcoming LLM Limitations

However, LLMs struggle to produce the correct action code consistently in one shot [41]. To address this challenge, we propose an **iterative prompting mechanism** that:

1. **Executes the generated program** to obtain observations from the Minecraft simulation (such as inventory listing and nearby creatures) and error trace from the code interpreter (if any).
2. **Incorporates the feedback** into GPT-4's prompt for another round of code refinement.
3. **Repeats the process** until a self-verification module confirms the task completion, at which point we commit the program to the skill library (e.g., `craftStoneShovel()` and `combatZombieWithSword()`) and query the automatic curriculum for the next milestone (Figure 2).

**Empirically**, VOYAGER demonstrates strong in-context lifelong learning capabilities. It can construct an ever-growing skill library of action programs that are reusable, interpretable, and generalizable to novel tasks. We evaluate VOYAGER systematically against other LLM-based agent techniques (e.g., ReAct [29], Reflexion [30], AutoGPT [28]) in MineDojo [23], an open-source Minecraft AI framework. 

VOYAGER outperforms prior SOTA by:
* Obtaining **3.3x more unique items**.
* Unlocking key tech tree milestones up to **15.3× faster**.
* Traversing **2.3× longer distances**. 

We further demonstrate that VOYAGER is able to utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks from scratch, while other methods struggle to generalize.

## 2. Method

VOYAGER consists of three novel components:

1. 🗺️ **Automatic curriculum** (Section 2.1) that suggests objectives for open-ended exploration.
2. 📚 **Skill library** (Section 2.2) for developing increasingly complex behaviors.
3. 🔄 **Iterative prompting mechanism** (Section 2.3) that generates executable code for embodied control.

    D --> E["Task: Craft 1 stone pickaxe / Kill 1 pig / Smelt 4 raw iron"]
```
*Figure 3: Tasks proposed by the automatic curriculum (partial prompt view).*

### 2.1 Automatic Curriculum 🗺️

Embodied agents encounter a variety of objectives with different complexity levels in open-ended environments. An automatic curriculum offers numerous benefits for open-ended exploration:
* Ensuring a challenging but manageable learning process.
* Fostering curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation for agents to learn and explore.
* Encouraging the development of general and flexible problem-solving strategies [42–44]. 

Our automatic curriculum capitalizes on the internet-scale knowledge contained within GPT-4 by prompting it to provide a steady stream of new tasks or challenges. The curriculum unfolds in a bottom-up fashion, allowing for considerable adaptability and responsiveness to the exploration progress and the agent's current state (Figure 3). As VOYAGER progresses to harder self-driven goals, it naturally learns a variety of skills, such as *"mining a diamond"*.

#### 🔧 Prompt Components

The input prompt to GPT-4 consists of several components:

1. **Directives encouraging diverse behaviors and imposing constraints**, such as:
   > *"My ultimate goal is to discover as many diverse things as possible. The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet."*
2. **The agent's current state**, including inventory, equipment, nearby blocks and entities, biome, time, health and hunger bars, and position.
3. **Previously completed and failed tasks**, reflecting the agent's current exploration progress and capabilities frontier.
4. **Additional context**: We also leverage GPT-3.5 to self-ask questions based on the agent's current state and exploration progress and self-answer questions. We opt to use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 for standard NLP tasks due to budgetary considerations.

        L --> M[Top-5 Relevant Skills]
    end
```
*Figure 4: Skill library operations. Top: Adding a new verified skill. Bottom: Skill retrieval based on task and environment feedback.*

### 2.2 Skill Library 📚

With the automatic curriculum consistently proposing increasingly complex tasks, it is essential to have a skill library that serves as a basis for learning and evolution. Inspired by the generality, interpretability, and universality of programs [45], we represent each skill with executable code that scaffolds temporally extended actions for completing a specific task proposed by the automatic curriculum.

#### 🔧 Prompt Components

The input prompt to GPT-4 consists of the following components:

1. **Guidelines for code generation**, such as:
   > *"Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable."*
2. **Control primitive APIs**, and relevant skills retrieved from the skill library, which are crucial for in-context learning [36–38] to work well.
3. **The generated code from the last round, environment feedback, execution errors, and critique**, based on which GPT-4 can self-improve (Section 2.3).
4. **The agent's current state**, including inventory, equipment, nearby blocks and entities, biome, time, health and hunger bars, and position.
5. **Chain-of-thought prompting** [46] to do reasoning before code generation.

We iteratively refine the program through a novel iterative prompting mechanism (Section 2.3), incorporate it into the skill library as a new skill, and index it by the embedding of its description (Figure 4, top). 

For **skill retrieval**, we query the skill library with the embedding of self-generated task plans and environment feedback (Figure 4, bottom). By continuously expanding and refining the skill library, VOYAGER can learn, adapt, and excel in a wide spectrum of tasks, consistently pushing the boundaries of its capabilities in the open world.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Environment Feedback
        A["I cannot make stick because I need: 2 more planks"] --> B[GPT-4 Code Refinement]
        B --> C["async function craftStoneShovelWithTable(bot) { ... }"]
    end

    subgraph Execution Error
        D["throw new Error('No item named acacia_axe');"] --> E[GPT-4 Error Correction]
        E --> F["Replace craftAcaciaAxe with craftWoodenAxe"]
    end
```
*Figure 5: Left: Environment feedback showing missing resources. Right: Execution error leading to automatic bug correction.*

### 2.3 Iterative Prompting Mechanism 🔄

We introduce an iterative prompting mechanism for self-improvement through three types of feedback:

1. **Environment feedback**, which illustrates the intermediate progress of program execution (Figure 5, left). 
   * *Example:* *"I cannot make an iron chestplate because I need: 7 more iron ingots"* highlights the cause of failure in crafting an iron chestplate. We use `bot.chat()` inside control primitive APIs to generate environment feedback and prompt GPT-4 to use this function as well during code generation.
2. **Execution errors** from the program interpreter that reveal any invalid operations or syntax errors in programs, which are valuable for bug fixing (Figure 5, right).
3. **Self-verification for checking task success**. Instead of manually coding success checkers for each new task proposed by the automatic curriculum, we instantiate another GPT-4 agent for self-verification. 
   * By providing VOYAGER's current state and the task to GPT-4, we ask it to act as a critic [47–49] and inform us whether the program achieves the task. In addition, if the task fails, it provides a critique by suggesting how to complete the task (Figure 6). 
   * Hence, our self-verification is more comprehensive than self-reflection [30] by both checking success and reflecting on mistakes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Self-Verification Examples
        A["Inventory (8/36): coal: 5... Task: Mine 5 coal ores"] --> B[GPT-4 Critic]
        B --> C["Reasoning: Mining coal ore gets coal... Success: True"]

        D["Inventory (10/36): copper_ingot: 3... Task: Craft a spyglass"] --> E[GPT-4 Critic]
        E --> F["Reasoning: You lack amethyst shards. Success: False. Critique: Mine amethyst underground."]
    end
```
*Figure 6: Self-verification examples assessing success and generating critiques.*

During each round of code generation, we execute the generated program to obtain environment feedback and execution errors from the code interpreter, which are incorporated into GPT-4's prompt for the next round of code refinement. This iterative process repeats until self-verification validates the task's completion, at which point we add this new skill to the skill library and ask the automatic curriculum for a new objective (Figure 2). 

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> If the agent gets stuck after **4 rounds** of code generation, then we query the curriculum for another task. 

This iterative prompting approach significantly improves program synthesis for embodied control, enabling VOYAGER to continuously acquire diverse skills without human intervention.

## 3. Experiments

### 3.1 Experimental Setup 🛠️

We leverage OpenAI's `gpt-4-0314` [35] and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` [50] APIs for text completion, along with `text-embedding-ada-002` [51] API for text embedding. 

* We set all temperatures to $0$ except for the automatic curriculum, which uses temperature $= 0.1$ to encourage task diversity. 
* Our simulation environment is built on top of MineDojo [23] and leverages Mineflayer [52] JavaScript APIs for motor controls. See Appendix, Section B.1 for more details.

### 3.2 Baselines 📊

Because there are no LLM-based agents that work out of the box for Minecraft, we make our best effort to select a number of representative algorithms as baselines. These methods are originally designed only for NLP tasks without embodiment, therefore we have to re-interpret them to be executable in MineDojo and compatible with our experimental setting:

* **ReAct [29]**: Uses chain-of-thought prompting [46] by generating both reasoning traces and action plans with LLMs. We provide it with our environment feedback and the agent states as observations.
* **Reflexion [30]**: Built on top of ReAct [29] with self-reflection to infer more intuitive future actions. We provide it with execution errors and our self-verification module.
* **AutoGPT [28]**: A popular software tool that automates NLP tasks by decomposing a high-level goal into multiple subgoals and executing them in a ReAct-style loop. We re-implement AutoGPT by using GPT-4 to do task decomposition and provide it with the agent states, environment feedback, and execution errors as observations for subgoal execution. Compared with VOYAGER, AutoGPT lacks the skill library for accumulating knowledge, self-verification for assessing task success, and automatic curriculum for open-ended exploration.

> 📝 **Notes**
>
> We do not directly compare with prior methods that take Minecraft screen pixels as input and output low-level controls [53–55]. It would not be an apple-to-apple comparison, because we rely on the high-level Mineflayer [52] API to control the agent.

### 3.3 Evaluation Results 📈

We systematically evaluate VOYAGER and baselines on their exploration performance, tech tree mastery, map coverage, and zero-shot generalization capability to novel tasks in a new world.

* 🔍 **Significantly better exploration:** VOYAGER's superiority is evident in its ability to consistently make new strides, discovering **63 unique items** within 160 prompting iterations—**3.3x more novel items** compared to its counterparts. AutoGPT lags considerably, while ReAct and Reflexion struggle to make significant progress.
* 🌳 **Consistent tech tree mastery:** The Minecraft tech tree tests the agent's ability to craft and use a hierarchy of tools (`wooden tool` ➔ `stone tool` ➔ `iron tool` ➔ `diamond tool`). Compared with baselines, VOYAGER unlocks the wooden level **15.3× faster**, the stone level **8.5× faster**, the iron level **6.4× faster**, and VOYAGER is the **only one** to unlock the diamond level (Table 1).

| Method | Wooden Tool | Stone Tool | Iron Tool | Diamond Tool |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **ReAct [29]** | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **Reflexion [30]** | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **AutoGPT [28]** | $92 \pm 72$ ($3/3$) | $94 \pm 72$ ($3/3$) | $135 \pm 103$ ($3/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **VOYAGER w/o Skill Library** | $7 \pm 2$ ($3/3$) | $9 \pm 4$ ($3/3$) | $29 \pm 11$ ($3/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **VOYAGER (Ours)** | **$6 \pm 2$ ($3/3$)** | **$11 \pm 2$ ($3/3$)** | **$21 \pm 7$ ($3/3$)** | **$102$ ($1/3$)** |

*Table 1: Tech tree mastery. Fractions indicate successful trials out of three total runs. Numbers are prompting iterations averaged over trials (fewer is more efficient).*

* 🗺️ **Extensive map traversal:** VOYAGER is able to navigate distances **2.3× longer** compared to baselines by traversing a variety of terrains, while baseline agents remain confined to local areas (Figure 7).

```mermaid

        B[ReAct / Reflexion / AutoGPT: Confined local clusters]
    end
```
*Figure 7: Bird's eye view of map coverage showing VOYAGER's extensive traversal across diverse terrains.*

* 🧠 **Efficient zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks:** VOYAGER consistently solves all tasks (`Diamond Pickaxe`, `Golden Sword`, `Lava Bucket`, `Compass`) in a newly instantiated world, while baselines cannot solve any task within 50 prompting iterations (Table 2). Interestingly, integrating VOYAGER's skill library into AutoGPT significantly boosts its performance, proving that the skill library is a plug-and-play asset.

| Method | Diamond Pickaxe | Golden Sword | Lava Bucket | Compass |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **ReAct [29]** | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **Reflexion [30]** | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **AutoGPT [28]** | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) |
| **AutoGPT [28] w/ Our Skill Library** | $39$ ($1/3$) | $30$ ($1/3$) | N/A ($0/3$) | $30$ ($2/3$) |
| **VOYAGER w/o Skill Library** | $36$ ($2/3$) | $30 \pm 9$ ($3/3$) | $27 \pm 9$ ($3/3$) | $26 \pm 3$ ($3/3$) |
| **VOYAGER (Ours)** | **$19 \pm 3$ ($3/3$)** | **$18 \pm 7$ ($3/3$)** | **$21 \pm 5$ ($3/3$)** | **$18 \pm 2$ ($3/3$)** |

*Table 2: Zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks across 3 trials (max 50 iterations).*

### 3.4 Ablation Studies 🔬

We ablate 6 design choices in VOYAGER:
1. **Automatic curriculum:** Replacing it with a random curriculum causes discovered item count to drop by **93%**. Manual curriculum requires heavy domain expertise and cannot adapt to agent states.
2. **Skill library:** Without it, VOYAGER exhibits a clear performance plateau in later stages, highlighting its role in building complex actions on top of mastered ones.
3. **Self-verification:** Removing this module leads to a **73% drop** in discovered items, proving it is the most crucial feedback mechanism for task progression.
4. **GPT-4 for code generation:** GPT-4 obtains **5.7× more unique items** than GPT-3.5 due to a quantum leap in coding capability.

### 3.5 Multimodal Feedback from Humans 👥

While current GPT-4 APIs are text-only, VOYAGER can be augmented with human feedback to construct complex 3D structures like a **Nether Portal** and a **House** (Figure 10):
* 👁️ **Human as a critic:** Providing visual critique to refine spatial details.
* 📚 **Human as a curriculum:** Breaking down complex building tasks into smaller steps.

---

## 4. Limitations and Future Work ⚠️

* 💰 **Cost:** GPT-4 API incurs significant costs (15× more expensive than GPT-3.5), though essential for code generation quality.
* 🐛 **Inaccuracies:** Occasionally the agent gets stuck or self-verification fails (e.g., missing spider string signals).
* 👻 **Hallucinations:** Automatic curriculum or GPT-4 may propose non-existent items (e.g., "copper sword") or invalid fuel inputs (e.g., cobblestone). Future LLM advances and open-source fine-tuning will address these.

---

## 5. Related Work 🔗

* **Decision-making Agents in Minecraft:** Prior work spans low-level controllers (hierarchical RL [66–68], MineDojo/VPT [8], DreamerV3 [69]) and high-level planners (Codex prompting [70], LLM subgoals [53, 55, 71]). VOYAGER uniquely combines curiosity-driven bottom-up automatic curriculum with executable code.
* **Large Language Models for Agent Planning:** Applied to robot learning (Inner Monologue [26], Code as Policies [16], ProgPrompt [22], PaLM-E [59]) and text agents (ReAct [29], Reflexion [30], AutoGPT [28], Generative Agents [82]). None feature an active skill library for lifelong behavioral accumulation.
* **Code Generation with Execution:** Execution-guided search [86–88], majority voting [89], LEVER [91], and CLAIRIFY [92]. VOYAGER integrates environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification into embodied control.

---

## 6. Conclusion 🏁

We introduced **VOYAGER**, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent. By leveraging GPT-4 for continuous exploration, skill acquisition, and discovery without human intervention, VOYAGER demonstrates superior performance across item discovery, tech tree mastery, map traversal, and zero-shot generalization.

#### A.3.2 Implementation Details

The control primitives are implemented as async functions wrapping Mineflayer APIs. Example implementations:

```javascript
// Explore in a direction until callback returns true
async function exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxTime, callback) {
    const goal = new GoalXZ(
        bot.entity.position.x + direction.x * 500,
        bot.entity.position.z + direction.z * 500
    );
    const timeout = Date.now() + maxTime * 1000;
    
    while (Date.now() < timeout) {
        await bot.pathfinder.goto(goal);
        if (callback()) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// Mine a specific block type
async function mineBlock(bot, name, count = 1) {
    const mcData = require('minecraft-data')(bot.version);
    const blockId = mcData.blocksByName[name].id;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        const block = bot.findBlock({
            matching: blockId,
            maxDistance: 32
        });
        
        if (!block) {
            bot.chat(`Cannot find ${name}`);
            return;
        }
        
        await bot.dig(block);
    }
}

// Craft an item
async function craftItem(bot, name, count = 1) {
    const mcData = require('minecraft-data')(bot.version);
    const recipe = bot.recipesFor(mcData.itemsByName[name].id)[0];
    
    if (!recipe) {
        bot.chat(`No recipe for ${name}`);
        return;
    }
    
    await bot.craft(recipe, count);
}

// Place a block
async function placeItem(bot, name, position) {
    const mcData = require('minecraft-data')(bot.version);
    const blockId = mcData.blocksByName[name].id;
    const block = bot.blockAt(position);
    const blockFace = new Vec3(0, 1, 0);
    
    await bot.placeBlock(block, blockFace);
}

// Smelt items in a furnace
async function smeltItem(bot, itemName, fuelName, count = 1) {
    const mcData = require('minecraft-data')(bot.version);
    const furnaceBlock = bot.findBlock({
        matching: mcData.blocksByName.furnace.id,
        maxDistance: 32
    });
    
    if (!furnaceBlock) {
        bot.chat("No furnace found");
        return;
    }
    
    await bot.openFurnace(furnaceBlock);
    const furnace = bot.currentWindow;
    const itemId = mcData.itemsByName[itemName].id;
    const fuelId = mcData.itemsByName[fuelName].id;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        await furnace.putInput(itemId);
        await furnace.putFuel(fuelId);
    }
}

// Get item from chest
async function moveToChest(bot, chestPosition) {
    await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalGetToBlock(
        chestPosition.x,
        chestPosition.y,
        chestPosition.z
    ));
}

async function closeChest(bot, chestBlock) {
    const chest = bot.currentWindow;
    if (chest) {
        await chest.close();
    }
}

// Get a torch from chest at (30 , 65 , 100) : getItemFromChest ( bot , new
Vec3 (30 , 65 , 100) , {" torch ": 1}) ;
// This function will work no matter how far the bot is from the chest
async function getItemFromChest(bot, chestPosition, itemsToGet) {
    await moveToChest(bot, chestPosition);
    const chestBlock = bot.blockAt(chestPosition);
    const chest = await bot.openContainer(chestBlock);
    for (const name in itemsToGet) {
        const itemByName = mcData.itemsByName[name];
        const item = chest.findContainerItem(itemByName.id);
        await chest.withdraw(item.type, null, itemsToGet[name]);
    }
    await closeChest(bot, chestBlock);
}

// Deposit a torch into chest at (30 , 65 , 100) : depositItemIntoChest (
// bot , new Vec3 (30 , 65 , 100) , {" torch ": 1}) ;
// This function will work no matter how far the bot is from the chest
async function depositItemIntoChest(bot, chestPosition, itemsToDeposit) {
    await moveToChest(bot, chestPosition);
    const chestBlock = bot.blockAt(chestPosition);
    const chest = await bot.openContainer(chestBlock);
    for (const name in itemsToDeposit) {
        const itemByName = mcData.itemsByName[name];
        const item = bot.inventory.findInventoryItem(itemByName.id);
        await chest.deposit(item.type, null, itemsToDeposit[name]);
    }
    await closeChest(bot, chestBlock);
}

// Check the items inside the chest at (30 , 65 , 100) :
// checkItemInsideChest ( bot , new Vec3 (30 , 65 , 100) ) ;
// You only need to call this function once without any action to
// finish task of checking items inside the chest .
async function checkItemInsideChest(bot, chestPosition) {
    await moveToChest(bot, chestPosition);
    const chestBlock = bot.blockAt(chestPosition);
    await bot.openContainer(chestBlock);
    await closeChest(bot, chestBlock);
}
```

**Pathfinding Goals:**
```javascript
// Move the bot to a block within the specified range
await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalNear(x, y, z, range));

// Long-range goals without specific Y level
await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalXZ(x, z));

// Get directly adjacent to block (for fishing, farming, etc.)
await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalGetToBlock(x, y, z));

// Follow an entity
await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalFollow(entity, range));

// Position for placing a block
await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalPlaceBlock(position, bot.world, {}));

// Look at a block
await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalLookAtBlock(position, bot.world, {}));
```

**Other Mineflayer Functions:**
```javascript
bot.isABed(bedBlock);                    // Check if block is a bed
bot.blockAt(position);                   // Get block at position
await bot.equip(item, destination);      // Equip item (hand, head, torso, legs, feet, off-hand)
await bot.consume();                     // Consume item in hand
await bot.fish();                        // Fish (must be at water, have fishing rod)
await bot.sleep(bedBlock);               // Sleep until sunrise
await bot.activateBlock(block);          // Right-click a block
await bot.lookAt(position);              // Look at position
await bot.activateItem();                // Right-click with item in hand
await bot.useOn(entity);                 // Right-click an entity
```

### A.4 Prompting Structure & Full Prompts 📝

#### A.4.1 Automatic Curriculum Prompt (Prompt 2)

**Prompt 2:** Full system prompt for automatic curriculum generation.

```
You are a helpful assistant that plays Minecraft and writes down the tasks to complete.
My ultimate goal is to discover as many diverse things as possible.

Your job is to give me a reasonable task to complete in Minecraft that brings me closer to this goal.
The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned 
enough skills to complete it yet.

Take into account these factors:
1. My current inventory
2. The biome I'm currently in
3. The entities nearby
4. The blocks nearby
5. My current health and hunger status
6. What I've already completed and failed

The task should be specific and achievable. Provide the task as a single sentence.

Examples of good tasks:
- "Mine 5 oak logs"
- "Craft a crafting table"
- "Build a shelter"
- "Catch 3 fish"
- "Find diamonds"

Do not suggest tasks that require items I don't have and cannot easily obtain.
```

#### A.4.2 Action Agent Prompt (Prompt 3)

**Prompt 3:** Full system prompt for code generation and action synthesis.

```
You are a helpful assistant that writes Minecraft code for Mineflayer, a JavaScript framework to 
create Minecraft bot clients.

Your job is to write a function that completes the task given by the user. The function should:
1. Be async and take the bot as the only argument
2. Use the provided utility functions (mineBlock, craftItem, etc.)
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Provide progress updates using bot.chat()
5. Be reusable and generic

{ retrieved_skills }

At each round of conversation, I will give you:
- Code from the last round
- Execution error
- Chat log
- Biome, Time, Nearby blocks, Nearby entities
- Health, Hunger, Position
- Equipment, Inventory, Chests
- Task, Context, Critique

You should respond with:
1. Explain: Any missing steps or issues with the plan/code?
2. Plan: Step-by-step approach to complete the task
3. Code: JavaScript async function implementation

Important guidelines:
- Reuse utility functions as much as possible
- Make functions generic and reusable
- Always check inventory before using items
- Use exploreUntil() to find blocks or mobs
- Call bot.chat() to show progress
- Never use infinite loops or recursive functions
- Don't register event listeners (bot.on/bot.once)
- Name functions meaningfully
```

#### A.4.3 Skill Library Examples 💾

**Example 1: craftWoodenPlanks**

```javascript
async function craftWoodenPlanks(bot) {
    const logNames = ["oak_log", "birch_log", "spruce_log", "jungle_log",

## Appendix B. Experiment Details & Additional Results 📊

### B.1 Experimental Setup 🛠️

**Environment Construction:**
Our simulation environment is built upon MineDojo [23] and utilizes Mineflayer [52] JavaScript APIs for motor controls. We incorporate numerous `bot.chat()` calls into Mineflayer functions to provide abundant environment feedback. Various condition checks and try-catch exceptions enable continuous execution through failures.

**Bot Respawning and Persistence:**
If the bot dies, it is resurrected near the closest ground with its inventory preserved for uninterrupted exploration. The bot recycles its crafting table and furnace after each program execution. For detailed implementations, refer to the project codebase.

**API Models Used:**
- **Code Generation:** `gpt-4-0314` [35]
- **Curriculum:** `gpt-4-0314`
- **Embedding:** `text-embedding-ada-002` [51]
- **Self-Verification:** `gpt-4-0314`
- **Supporting NLP:** `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` [50] (for cost efficiency)

**Temperature Settings:**
- Automatic curriculum: $\tau = 0.1$ (encourages task diversity)
- All other components: $\tau = 0$ (deterministic)

### B.2 Baseline Descriptions 📋

**ReAct [29]:** Uses chain-of-thought prompting by generating both reasoning traces and action plans. We provide it with environment feedback and agent states. ReAct undergoes one round of code generation from scratch, followed by three rounds of refinement, repeated until max iterations.

**Reflexion [30]:** Built on ReAct with self-reflection to infer future actions. We provide environment feedback, agent states, execution errors, and our self-verification module. Similar iteration scheme to ReAct.

**AutoGPT [28]:** Decomposes high-level goals into subgoals executing in a ReAct-style loop. We re-implement it with GPT-4 for task decomposition. Lacks VOYAGER's skill library, self-verification, and automatic curriculum. Each subgoal is refined up to 3 additional rounds, then moves to next subgoal. If 3 consecutive subgoals don't acquire new items, replans.

**Task Specification:** The task for all baselines and VOYAGER is: "Explore the world and get as many items as possible."

### B.3 Ablation Studies 🧪

We ablate 6 design choices:

1. **Manual Curriculum:** A pre-designed sequence to mine a diamond: "Mine 3 wood log" → "Craft 1 crafting table" → ... → "Mine 1 diamond". Requires heavy domain expertise.

2. **Random Curriculum:** Randomly selects from 101 items as next task.

3. **w/o Skill Library:** Removes skill library, eliminating skill retrieval during code generation.

4. **w/o Environment Feedback:** Excludes chat logs from code generation prompts.

5. **w/o Execution Errors:** Excludes execution error traces from prompts.

6. **w/o Self-Verification:** Removes self-verification; refines program for 3 rounds without success checking.

7. **GPT-3.5 for Code:** Replaces GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 for code generation only (keeps GPT-4 for curriculum and verification).
