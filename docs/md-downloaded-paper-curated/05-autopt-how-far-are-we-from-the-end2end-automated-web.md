## 📌 Executive Summary

> 💡 **Core Finding**  
> Unconstrained LLM-based penetration testing agents struggle with context window limits, repetitive execution loops, and command hallucinations. By embedding LLMs within a **Penetration Testing State Machine (PSM)** inspired by Finite State Machines (FSM), **AutoPT** increases end-to-end task completion rates from **22% to 41%** while reducing execution time by **50%** and financial API costs by **71.6%** compared to standard ReAct baselines.

Penetration testing is essential to ensure Web security by detecting and fixing vulnerabilities prior to exploitation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess powerful reasoning capabilities, unguided agents frequently fail at complete end-to-end penetration tasks due to context width overflow, depth-first search trap loops on minor errors, and command syntax hallucinations.

To address these limitations, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end web penetration testing benchmark covering OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities across 20 real-world containerized environments. Based on empirical insights, we propose **AutoPT**, an automated multi-state penetration testing framework driven by LLMs and constrained by state transitions. AutoPT significantly outperforms existing ReAct and Penetration Testing Tree (PTT) agent baselines, operating at **99.6% lower cost** than human expert penetration testers.

## 1. Introduction

Web security [53] is a daunting challenge. Penetration testing [52, 60] and red team testing [55] are vital for evaluating Web security by simulating real-world hacker attacks [6]. In 2024, Bank of America suffered a major data breach when service provider Infosys McCamish Systems was hit by ransomware, exposing sensitive data for over 60,000 customers. Comprehensive pre-launch penetration testing can identify and remediate such vulnerabilities before deployment.

Currently, penetration testing remains a labor-intensive process conducted by skilled human experts using semi-automated tools [14]. While rule-based methods [5, 23, 70] and deep reinforcement learning solutions [47] have been explored, none achieve **end-to-end automated penetration testing**—defined as the complete execution of vulnerability discovery and exploitation without human intervention across diverse environments.

### Benchmark
To evaluate LLM capabilities in end-to-end testing, we observed that existing benchmarks (e.g., CTF challenges [9, 51] or complex HackTheBox targets [1]) are either unrepresentative of real web scenarios or overly complex for single-agent architectures. We created a refined benchmark covering the **OWASP Top 10** [54] list using Docker environments from Vulhub [58], annotated with step-complexity levels and explicit verification strings.

### Motivation
Despite advances in LLM reasoning [15, 21, 39, 61] and tool-use agent frameworks [36, 40, 62], fully automated web penetration testing has remained elusive. Prior tools like PentestGPT [13] assist human operators but require continuous human interaction. This raises the fundamental question:

> ❓ **Research Question**  
> *How far are we from end-to-end automated Web penetration testing?*

### Our Methodology
We address core agent limitations by introducing the **Penetration Testing State Machine (PSM)**, based on Finite State Machine (FSM) theory [64]. AutoPT structures penetration tasks into modular **Agent States** (*Scanning*, *Reconnaissance*, *Exploitation*) and deterministic **Rule States** (*Selection*, *Check*). By substituting global dialog context history with targeted inter-state outputs, AutoPT prevents context overflow and loop trapping.

### Key Contributions

1. 🎯 **Fine-Grained End-to-End Benchmark:** Built 20 out-of-the-box containerized environments covering OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with granular step-complexity annotations and explicit verification flag targets.
2. 🏗️ **Novel Agent Architecture (PSM & AutoPT):** Formalized the Pen-testing State Machine and implemented AutoPT to enforce structured state transitions and context partitioning.
3. 📊 **First Comprehensive Empirical Study:** Evaluated multiple LLM backbones (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini) across ReAct, PTT, and AutoPT architectures, demonstrating a cost reduction of **99.6% vs. human experts**.

## 2. Background & Related Work

### 2.1 Related Work

#### 2.1.1 Penetration Testing
Classic penetration testing follows six phases [12]: 
1. Planning & Reconnaissance
2. Scanning & Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Post-Exploitation
5. Reporting & Recommendations
6. Re-testing

Achieving full automation is challenging because agents must comprehend vast domain knowledge, filter noise across stages, and navigate diverse command-line and web interface tools [16, 71].

#### 2.1.2 Large Language Model Agents
Recent work applies LLMs to security tasks, such as privilege escalation on Linux VMs (Wintermute [27], Happe et al. [24]) or semi-automated web application parsing (PentestGPT [13]). AutoPT advances this frontier by achieving fully autonomous, end-to-end web penetration testing.

### 2.2 Task Definition

End-to-end black-box web penetration testing simulates an external attacker with zero prior knowledge of the target's internal architecture, code, or server configurations [7, 49]. 

For this study, we focus on the core technical phases:

## 3. End2End Penetration Testing Benchmark

### 3.1 Benchmark Motivation

Existing benchmarks lack standard environment specifications or explicit stop-signal targets.

> 📋 **Table 1: Comparison of Penetration Testing Benchmark Standards**

| Benchmark Name | Standardized Docker Envs | Explicit Target Verification | Granular Step Annotation |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **PentestGPT Bench** [13] | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **AutoPT Benchmark (Ours)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### 3.2 Benchmark Design

1. **Task Selection:** Selected 20 containerized CVE targets from Vulhub [58] spanning OWASP Top 10 2023 categories (RCE, LFI, SQLi, SSRF, Deserialization, etc.).
2. **Task Annotation:** Categorized difficulty based on manual execution steps:
   - **Simple Vulnerabilities:** $< 3$ exploit steps (e.g., single HTTP request exploit).
   - **Complex Vulnerabilities:** $\ge 3$ exploit steps (e.g., multi-stage payload crafting, cookie handling, or route registration).
3. **Target Verification:** Formulated explicit target objective strings (e.g., verifying `cat /etc/passwd` output like `apt:x:100:65534`).
4. **Task Validation:** Environment validated independently across multiple isolated server deployments.

## 4. Motivation & Preliminary Experiments

### 4.1 Motivation Example

When evaluated under direct ReAct [65] architectures, agents often exhibit repetitive troubleshooting loops—such as pinging target IPs or re-verifying port connectivity upon receiving a 404 error from an invalid PoC payload—wasting context and execution turns.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent as ReAct LLM Agent
    participant Env as Target Web App / Kali Docker
    Agent->>Env: Execute Xray Scan on Target IP
    Env-->>Agent: Returns Scan Log with PoC Links
    Agent->>Env: Execute PoC curl request -> Returns 404
    Note over Agent: Trapped in Depth-First Search Loop
    Agent->>Env: Ping target IP / Change encoding / Modify headers repeatedly
    Env-->>Agent: Task Fails due to Context Window Overflow (128k limit exceeded)
```

*Fig. 1. Motivating example illustrating the repetitive failure loop of a direct ReAct agent.*

### Key Challenges Identified

> ⚠️ **Challenge 1: Context Size Limits**  
> Retaining raw message history (including full HTML/CSS responses from `curl`) quickly fills context windows and degrades reasoning quality.

> ⚠️ **Challenge 2: Depth-First Search Loops**  
> Agents fixate on single failing PoCs, tweaking encoding or headers indefinitely instead of switching targets.

> ⚠️ **Challenge 3: Hallucinations & Unconfidence**  
> Models output invalid tool options or prematurely declare vulnerability exploitation impossible.

## 5. Methodology

### 5.1 Overview

In response to the challenges raised in the previous section, we propose **AutoPT**, an end-to-end penetration testing framework built around the concept of a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**. The full task is decomposed into multiple states, and the workflow is completed through explicit state transitions. As shown in the figure below, AutoPT contains two distinct state types:

- **Agent States**: vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance, and exploitation states, each powered by an LLM-based agent and the external tools required for that subtask.
- **Rule States**: vulnerability selection and completion check states, which enforce deterministic rule-based matching to improve efficiency and reduce error propagation.

The system interacts with target websites and internet information through the external tools attached to these modules. In the following sections, we explain the design rationale and engineering details behind AutoPT.

```mermaid

    S0["Initialization (s0)"] --> S1["Scanning State (Agent State)"]
    S1 --> S2["Vulnerability Selection (Rule State)"]
    S2 --> S3["Reconnaissance State (Agent State)"]
    S3 --> S4["Exploitation State (Agent State)"]
    S4 --> S5["Target Check (Rule State)"]
    S5 -- "Target Found" --> F_SUCCESS["Final State: SUCCESS"]
    S5 -- "Check Failed & Retries < Threshold" --> S4
    S5 -- "Check Failed & Retries Exceeded" --> S2
    S2 -- "Vulnerability Library Exhausted" --> F_FAIL["Final State: FAILED"]
```

*Fig. 2. AutoPT workflow overview.*

### 5.2 Design Rationale & Formal Definitions

In accordance with the preliminary conclusions of Section 4.2, we design AutoPT to address three core challenges:

1. **History Maintenance:** Use inter-state outputs rather than maintaining a full dialog history for the entire end-to-end penetration testing system.
2. **Cycling Failure:** Prevent the model from being trapped in repetitive attempts on a single local failure.
3. **Model Capability Limits:** Reduce task difficulty through external constraints and state-machine control.

AutoPT aims to make the system more suitable for end-to-end penetration testing by letting the architecture enforce structure instead of relying on prompt engineering alone. We draw inspiration from traditional state-machine design, divide the end-to-end task into multiple states, and solve subtasks through explicit transitions. Each state solves its own task independently, passes only the essential information to the next state, and avoids preserving the entire task context across the full workflow. This helps ensure that errors do not propagate through the entire process and allows corrective behavior to be applied at the appropriate state boundary.

#### Definition 1 (Finite State Machine - FSM)
A finite state machine $\text{FSM}$ is a state-labeled, attributed automaton
$$
\mathcal{M} = (S, s_0, \Sigma, \delta, O, F)
$$
where $S$ is a set of states, $s_0 \in S$ is the initial state, $\Sigma$ is a set of input symbols, $\delta : S \times \Sigma \to S$ is the transition function, $O : S \times \Sigma \to \Gamma$ is an output function producing symbols in $\Gamma$, and $F \subseteq S$ is the set of final or accepting states.

In a finite state machine, the state carries information about the history of the machine and tracks how the machine reaches its current situation. We decompose the end-to-end penetration testing process into multiple states and model each stage as part of a state machine. In AutoPT, each node is treated as a Mealy-style machine, where the system prompt or the contextual interaction from the previous state is taken as the input symbol.

#### Definition 2 (Pen-testing State Machine - PSM)
We formalize the Pen-testing State Machine as a six-tuple:
$$
\mathcal{PSM} = (S, s_0, \Sigma, \delta, O, F)
$$

- **State Set ($S$):** Each state corresponds to a predefined situation or configuration of the system. After entering a given state, the PSM executes a set of expected operations.
- **Initial State ($s_0$):** When the target machine IP, port, and task target are received, AutoPT is initialized and the process begins from the initial state.
- **Input Alphabet ($\Sigma$):** We define $\Sigma$ as the message set formed by the context output $O$ from the previous state and optional environment feedback $T_{env}$.
- **Transition Function ($\delta$):** $\delta : S \times \Sigma \to S$, mapping the current state and input symbol to the next state.
- **Output Function ($O$):** $O : S \times \Sigma \to \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the message set emitted by the current state and its tool interactions.
- **Final States ($F$):** The accepting terminal states of the process: **Success** and **Failed**.

Similar to the traditional FSM, the output function differs per node. In particular, AutoPT partitions its states into:

- **Agent States**: LLM-driven states using role-play prompts and task-specific tools.
- **Rule States**: deterministic states that sanitize and match contextual information to enforce structural constraints.

This division directly addresses the challenge of maintaining full context history. Instead of retaining all previous dialogue, each state only needs the core task context and the output of the previous state.

### 5.3 Implementation

#### 5.3.1 Agent State Process

Agent states combine role-play system prompts, task-specific tools, and iteration limits to execute subtasks.

```python
# Pseudocode representation of Algorithm 1: Agent State Process
def agent_state_process(P_init, I_input, Model_L, Tools_T, Max_Iter, Parse_F, Output_Parse_O):
    P_star = P_init + I_input
    step = 0
    while step <= Max_Iter:
        llm_response = Model_L(P_star)
        L_out, T_inv, T_in = Parse_F(llm_response)

        if T_inv is not None:
            T_out = Tools_T.execute(T_inv, T_in)
            P_star += L_out + T_out
        else:
            P_star += L_out

        if Model_L.exits_state():
            break
        step += 1

    Gamma = Output_Parse_O(P_star)
    return Gamma
```

- **Tools Provided:**
  - *Scanning State:* Local Kali Linux Docker Terminal (root privileges).
  - *Reconnaissance State:* Search & URL Access tool.
  - *Exploitation State:* Terminal & Playwright Headless Browser.

#### 5.3.2 Rule State Process

Rule states sanitize context (for example, removing scanner header noise such as `[INFO]`) and apply deterministic matching logic without consuming LLM API calls.

```python
# Pseudocode representation of Algorithm 2: Rule State Process
def rule_state_process(I_input, Rules_R, Parse_F, Output_Gen_O):
    I_cleaned = Parse_F(I_input)
    Gamma = Output_Gen_O(I_cleaned, Rules_R)
    return Gamma
```

#### 5.3.3 Overall State Machine Transition Algorithm

```python
# Pseudocode representation of Algorithm 3: PSM Process
def psm_process(IP, Task_Target_T, System_Prompt_P, PSM_Graph):
    Gamma = System_Prompt_P + IP + Task_Target_T
    Gamma_history = [Gamma]
    current_state = PSM_Graph.s0

    while current_state not in PSM_Graph.F:
        if current_state.type == "Agent":
            Gamma = agent_state_process(current_state.prompt, Gamma, current_state.model,
                                        current_state.tools, current_state.max_iter)
        else:
            Gamma = rule_state_process(Gamma, current_state.rules)

        current_state = PSM_Graph.delta(current_state, Gamma)
        Gamma_history.append(Gamma)

    return current_state, Gamma_history
```

## 7. Validity Analysis

### 7.1 Internal Threats
- **Scanner Reliability:** Inaccurate scanner results could mislead downstream modules. Mitigated by verifying Xray configuration rules manually.
- **Model Alignment:** Safety filters occasionally block explicit exploitation terms ("I cannot assist with that"). Mitigated via authorized penetration testing role-playing prompts.

### 7.2 External Threats
- **Target Selection:** Dockerized Vulhub targets may not reflect all custom web application stacks. Mitigated by evaluating 20 environments across 4 major vulnerability categories.

---

## 8. Discussion and Limitations

- **State of Automation:** While AutoPT demonstrates significant progress, current agents remain bounded by base LLM reasoning limits when facing zero-day vulnerabilities requiring novel exploit synthesis.
- **Defensive Applications:** Autonomous penetration testing frameworks can be used for continuous automated red-teaming. Defense mechanisms should evaluate LLM-generated attack traffic patterns [11, 37].

---

## 9. Conclusion

We presented **AutoPT**, the first autonomous end-to-end web penetration testing system driven by a **Pen-testing State Machine (PSM)**. By combining LLM-driven Agent States with rule-based transition constraints, AutoPT addresses context overflow, prevents execution loops, and achieves a **41% task completion rate** at a fraction of human or unconstrained agent costs.
