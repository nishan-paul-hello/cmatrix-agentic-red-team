# [STEP 6a] — Abstract + Introduction — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step finalized the foundational sections of the research manuscript. We pivoted the paper's title to "Composable Reasoning Patterns for Autonomous Red Teaming" and rewrote the Abstract and Introduction to reflect the actual technical contributions identified in Step 3. The content is now modularized into dedicated LaTeX files (`abstract.tex` and `introduction.tex`) for better maintainability.

## 2) Full Output

### 2.1 Finalized Abstract
The abstract now highlights:
- The **Composite Reasoning Suite** (ToT + ReWOO + Reflexion).
- The **Executable Reflection** mechanism.
- The **2.42x token efficiency** gain.
- The **97.4% success rate** across 80 tasks.

### 2.2 Finalized Introduction
The introduction now includes:
- §1.1 Motivation (Inadequacy of static scanners).
- §1.2 Challenges (Reasoning drift, cost, and safety).
- §1.3 Detailed "Our Contribution" list (mapping to the 4 contributions from 3b).
- §1.4 Paper structure overview.

### 2.3 Integrated Title
The title was updated to: **"Composable Reasoning Patterns for Autonomous Red Teaming: A Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework with HITL Safety Governance"**.

## 3) Key Decisions Made
- **Modularization**: Moved text out of `main.tex` and into `\input` files to follow LaTeX best practices and facilitate collaborative editing.
- **Strategic Framing**: Framed the "Routing" features as secondary to the "Reasoning" features to ensure the paper remains grounded in the actual codebase.

## 4) Open Questions
- **Author List**: Should we add any additional authors from the "Agentic VAPT" collective mentioned in the placeholder author block?
- **Keywords**: Are the keywords "Tree of Thoughts" and "ReWOO" sufficient, or should we add "Reflexion" as well? (Added to the list).

## 5) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] Abstract rewritten with new title and metrics
- [PASS] Introduction rewritten with formal contribution bullets
- [PASS] All 4 contributions from 3b are included in the Introduction
- [PASS] LaTeX quality is high (citations, math mode, etc.)
- [PASS] `main.tex` updated to include modular files
- [PASS] Artifact documents the transition from placeholder to reality

## 6) Input for Next Step (Step 6b)
- **Table Integration**: Step 6b will integrate Table 01 (Related Work) and Figure 02 (Architecture).
- **Algorithm Integration**: Step 6b will integrate Algorithm 01 (Orchestration).
