# [STEP 6i] — Main Paper Assembly — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step performed the final structural assembly of the research manuscript. We migrated all modular section files to a dedicated `sections/` directory and centralized the `main.tex` master file in the project root. We also ensured that all asset paths (figures, tables, equations, references) resolve correctly from the new directory structure. The resulting project layout is clean, professional, and ready for full-document compilation.

## 2) Full Output

### 2.1 Final Directory Structure
- `main.tex`: Master execution spine.
- `sections/`: Contains `abstract.tex`, `introduction.tex`, `related_work.tex`, `threat_model.tex`, `methodology.tex`, `evaluation.tex`, `discussion.tex`, `conclusion.tex`.
- `assets/`: Contains all `.tex` figure/table/algorithm assets, `equations.tex`, and `references.bib`.

### 2.2 Path Verification
- All `\input{sections/...}` in `main.tex` resolve correctly.
- All `\input{assets/...}` in section files resolve correctly.
- `\bibliography{assets/references}` resolves correctly.

## 3) Key Decisions Made
- **Centralized Assets**: Moved `references.bib` and `equations.tex` into the `assets/` directory to keep the project root clean and follow the strict asset protocol.
- **Root Main**: Positioned `main.tex` in the root of `paper-04-agent-reasoning/` to simplify the build pipeline and align with the `Makefile` targets.
- **Path Rewriting**: Used `sed` to programmatically update asset paths across all 8 section files, ensuring zero broken references.

## 4) Open Questions
- **None**: Structural assembly is complete.

## 5) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] `main.tex` created and complete in the root
- [PASS] All section files exist in `sections/`
- [PASS] All asset files exist in `assets/` (including references and equations)
- [PASS] All `\input{}` paths in `main.tex` resolve correctly
- [PASS] All `\ref{}` keys exist (verified via audit)
- [PASS] All `\cite{}` keys exist in `references.bib`
- [PASS] `ASSET-INDEX.md` is fully up to date
- [PASS] File structure matches the planned layout exactly
- [PASS] No file contains placeholder content

## 6) Input for Next Step (Step 7a)
- **Document Read**: Step 7a (Hostile Peer Review) requires reading the *entire* assembled paper as a single coherent narrative.
- **Rigorous Stress-Testing**: Evaluate the transitions between sections and the internal consistency of the technical claims.

## 7) Asset Files Created/Moved
- `docs/paper-research/paper-04-agent-reasoning/main.tex`: Master file.
- `docs/paper-research/paper-04-agent-reasoning/assets/equations.tex`: Consolidated equations.
- `docs/paper-research/paper-04-agent-reasoning/assets/references.bib`: BibTeX source.
