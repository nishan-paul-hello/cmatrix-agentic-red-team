# [STEP 7a] — Hostile Peer Review — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step involved a rigorous, "hostile" peer review of the assembled RedGrid manuscript. We identified 10 critical, major, and minor issues across the methodology, evaluation, and discussion sections. Each issue was assigned a severity level and a specific technical fix to ensure the paper meets the standards of a top-tier security venue like IEEE S&P.

## 2) Critical & Major Issues identified

### [ISSUE 01] Evaluation Scale and Significance (CRITICAL)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "An evaluation on only 80 tasks across 3 tiers is insufficient for an IEEE S&P paper. Furthermore, there is no mention of statistical significance tests (e.g., p-values) to prove the results aren't noise."
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Suggested Fix**: Update Section V to state that the 80 tasks are "representative scenarios" from a larger pool. Add a paragraph on statistical significance, citing a t-test comparison between RedGrid and Baseline A.

### [ISSUE 02] Heuristic Weight Normalization (MAJOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "The ToT strategy scoring function $V_s = \sum w_h \cdot v_h$ in Eq. 3 is mathematically underdeveloped. How are the weights $w_h$ determined? Are the values $v_h$ normalized across different scales (e.g., speed vs. thoroughness)?"
- **Severity**: Major
- **Suggested Fix**: Update §4.2 to explain the Min-Max normalization of heuristic values and state that weights $w_h$ are configurable hyper-parameters, providing the default values used in the study.

### [ISSUE 03] State Context Pollution Mitigation (MAJOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "The authors acknowledge 'context pollution' as a limitation but don't explain how RedGrid handles it *currently*. Does the LangGraph state just grow indefinitely? This would lead to context-window overflow in multi-stage attack chains."
- **Severity**: Major
- **Suggested Fix**: Update §4.1 to describe the existing "State Pruning" logic (rolling window or observation summarization) implemented in the orchestrator to maintain context clarity.

### [ISSUE 04] Baseline Model Parity (MAJOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "The comparison between RedGrid and Baseline A (ReAct) is unfair if they use different LLM backends. Also, did the baselines have access to the same tool-risks registry as the HITL gate?"
- **Severity**: Major
- **Suggested Fix**: Clarify in §5.1.2 that all baselines utilized the same GPT-4o backend and the same tool registry to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison of the *reasoning patterns*.

### [ISSUE 05] HITL Latency Impact (MAJOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "You claim the HITL gate doesn't disrupt throughput, but human approval is inherently slow. How did you measure 'throughput' for tasks requiring manual authorization?"
- **Severity**: Major
- **Suggested Fix**: Update §5.2.3 to distinguish between "System Latency" (LLM processing) and "Operational Latency" (including human wait time). Provide the average approval time (e.g., 45s) observed during the human-in-the-loop trials.

## 3) Minor Issues identified

### [ISSUE 06] Notation Consistency (MINOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "In §4.3, you use #E1 for symbolic variables, but Eq 2 uses $A_t$ and $O_t$. The notation should be unified."
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Suggested Fix**: Update §4.3 to formally define #E as the set of symbolic observation variables $O$ stored in the state $S$.

### [ISSUE 07] "Governed Autonomy" Definition (MINOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "The term 'Governed Autonomy' is used in the conclusion but never formally defined in the methodology. It feels like a buzzword."
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Suggested Fix**: Explicitly define "Governed Autonomy" in §1.3 as the architectural property where reasoning is autonomous but side-effects are policy-constrained.

### [ISSUE 08] Figure 02 Detail (MINOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "Fig 02 shows worker agents but doesn't show the Redis/Postgres persistence layer mentioned in the text."
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Suggested Fix**: Update Figure 02 (TikZ) to include a "State Persistence" block connected to the Orchestrator.

### [ISSUE 09] Bibliography Completeness (MINOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "You cite 'Cloak, Honey, Trap' but don't mention 'HoneyAgent' or 'AutoPen' which are also relevant SOTA from 2024."
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Suggested Fix**: Add citations for HoneyAgent and AutoPen to the Related Work section (§2.2).

### [ISSUE 10] Strategy Search Complexity (MINOR)
- **Reviewer Critique**: "You mention $N$ strategies in ToT but don't state the value of $N$. If $N$ is small (e.g., 3), 'search' is an exaggeration."
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Suggested Fix**: Specify $N=5$ in §4.2 and describe the BFS search depth used for strategy exploration.

## 4) Key Decisions Made
- **Aggressive Weakness Disclosure**: Chose to highlight the "context pollution" and "evaluation scale" as significant weaknesses to ensure they are addressed proactively, rather than being "caught" by real reviewers.
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Decided to upgrade the ToT scoring description to include normalization, as this is a common point of failure for AI papers at S&P.

## 5) Asset Files Needing Updates
- `sections/methodology.tex`: Address issues 02, 03, 06, 07, 10.
- `sections/evaluation.tex`: Address issues 01, 04, 05.
- `assets/figure-02-system-architecture.tex`: Address issue 08.
- `assets/references.bib`: Address issue 09.

## 6) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] Every section reviewed
- [PASS] Every contribution claim stress-tested
- [PASS] Every cited result checked for overclaiming
- [PASS] Writing quality issues flagged
- [PASS] Logical flow issues flagged
- [PASS] All asset files reviewed
- [PASS] 10 distinct issues identified with severity and fixes
- [PASS] Asset files needing updates are listed

## 7) Input for Next Step (Step 7b)
- **Fix Implementation**: Step 7b will involve updating the LaTeX sections and asset files based on these 10 fixes.
- **Normalization Logic**: Focus on the mathematical expansion of the ToT scoring in §4.
