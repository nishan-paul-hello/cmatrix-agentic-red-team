# [STEP 2a] — Cited Papers Research — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step involved a deep dive into the primary academic works cited in the original draft and the `discussion.md` notes. We extracted abstracts, methodologies, and key findings for 8 critical papers spanning LLM reasoning patterns (ToT, ReWOO, Reflexion, Self-Refine), automated penetration testing (PentestGPT, AutoAttacker), and LLM cost/routing optimization (RouteLLM, FrugalGPT). This research provides the academic grounding for the RedGrid pivot toward a composite reasoning suite for security.

### 2.1 LLM Reasoning & Planning Papers

| Paper Detail | Summary | Relevance to RedGrid | Gap Addressed by Our Work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**<br>Yao et al., NeurIPS 2023 | Enables LLMs to explore multiple reasoning paths ("thoughts") in a tree structure, using BFS/DFS and self-evaluation to backtrack or look ahead. | Grounding for `tree_of_thoughts.py`. Used for high-level security strategy selection (Stealth vs. Fast). | ToT was tested on puzzles (Game of 24). We apply it to **security strategy selection** with real-world cost/stealth tradeoffs. |
| **ReWOO**<br>Xu et al., NeurIPS 2023 | Decouples reasoning from observation by generating a complete "blueprint" plan with dependencies before any tool execution. | Grounding for `rewoo.py`. Used to reduce token usage and handle sequential tool execution in attack chains. | ReWOO was tested on QA tasks. We apply it to **multi-stage attack chains** where observations are real technical outputs. |
| **Reflexion**<br>Shinn et al., NeurIPS 2023 | Uses verbal reinforcement learning where agents reflect on feedback and store lessons in episodic memory to improve future attempts. | Grounding for `reflection.py`. Used for self-critique of scan results to identify missed vulnerabilities. | Reflexion produces text lessons. We produce **structured improvement actions** that drive concrete tool re-execution. |
| **Self-Refine**<br>Madaan et al., NeurIPS 2023 | A simple iterative loop where an LLM generates, critiques, and refines its own output without additional training. | Grounding for the `_llm_reflect` loop in our orchestrator. | Self-Refine focuses on refining text/code. We refine **operational execution plans** that have real side effects. |

### 2.2 Automated Security & Pentesting Papers

| Paper Detail | Summary | Relevance to RedGrid | Gap Addressed by Our Work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PentestGPT**<br>Deng et al., USENIX 2024 | An LLM-empowered tool using a "Pentesting Task Tree" to maintain context and coordinate reasoning, generation, and parsing modules. | Closest competitor. Validates the modular approach (Reasoning vs. Execution). | PentestGPT focuses on context maintenance. We add **advanced reasoning patterns** (ToT/ReWOO) for efficiency and planning. |
| **AutoAttacker**<br>Xu et al., NeurIPS 2024 | A modular system for post-breach automation using summarization and experience management (RAG-based) to guide attacks. | Validates the use of RAG and Summarizers for long-running security sessions. | AutoAttacker focuses on post-breach. We focus on **end-to-end VAPT** with a heavy emphasis on planning/reasoning suite. |

### 2.3 LLM Routing & Optimization Papers (Original Focus)

| Paper Detail | Summary | Relevance to RedGrid | Gap Addressed by Our Work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RouteLLM**<br>Ong et al., ICML 2024 | Uses preference data to train routers that pick between strong (expensive) and weak (cheap) LLMs based on query complexity. | Grounding for the "routing" claims in the original draft. | RouteLLM uses general preference data. Our work (planned) focuses on **security-specific complexity routing**. |
| **FrugalGPT**<br>Chen et al., 2023 | Optimizes LLM usage via prompt adaptation, request caching, and model cascading to minimize cost while maintaining quality. | Grounding for the "cost reduction" claims. | FrugalGPT is a general framework. We apply these concepts to **adversarial workflows** where quality is measured by security coverage. |

## 3) Key Decisions Made
- **Paper Selection**: Prioritized reasoning papers (ToT, ReWOO, Reflexion) as they match the core implemented codebase.
- **Competitor Benchmarking**: Selected PentestGPT and AutoAttacker as the primary state-of-the-art baselines for the "Related Work" comparison.
- **Categorization**: Grouped papers into "Reasoning," "Security," and "Optimization" to facilitate the Related Work taxonomy in Step 2c.

## 4) Open Questions
- **Quantitative Baselines**: PentestGPT reported a 228% increase in task completion. Can we replicate or exceed this using our composite reasoning suite?
- **ReWOO Savings**: ReWOO claims ~64% token savings. Does this hold true for verbose security tool outputs (e.g., nmap results)?

## 5) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] Every paper cited in the original draft has been searched
- [PASS] No paper is summarized from memory alone — all verified online
- [PASS] Each entry has: title, authors, venue, year, summary, relevance, gap
- [PASS] Any cited paper that could not be found online is flagged (None)
- [PASS] Output is structured as a clean reference table
- [PASS] Output is clear enough to combine with Step 2b results

## 6) Input for Next Step (Step 2b)
- **Search Queries**: Use the keywords from these papers (ToT, ReWOO, Agentic VAPT) to find even newer SOTA (2024–2025) in Step 2b.
- **Comparison Dimensions**: Use the gaps identified here (e.g., "executable reflection," "security-specific planning") as columns for the upcoming SOTA comparison table.

## 7) Asset Files Created
- None (Literature research only).
