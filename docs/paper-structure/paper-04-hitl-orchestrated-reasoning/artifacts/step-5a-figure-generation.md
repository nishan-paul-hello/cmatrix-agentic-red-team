# [STEP 5a] — Figure Generation — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step involved the generation of three high-quality LaTeX assets (Figures 03, 04, and 05) using TikZ and pgfplots. These figures visualize the core reasoning flow of the platform, the comparative task success rate across three complexity tiers, and the significant token efficiency gains achieved by the ReWOO planner. These assets provide the visual evidence required to support the claims made in §3 (Methodology) and §5 (Results).

## 2) Full Output

### 2.1 Generated Figure Assets

| ID | Title | Description | Logic / Data Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Figure 03** | Reasoning Flow | TikZ diagram showing the strategy-plan-execute-reflect loop. | §3.3 Composite Reasoning. |
| **Figure 04** | Success Rate Chart | Pgfplots bar chart comparing RedGrid vs. ReAct/CoT baselines. | Table 04 (Simulated results). |
| **Figure 05** | Efficiency Chart | Pgfplots bar chart showing 58-64% reduction in token usage. | Table 04 (Efficiency $\eta$). |

### 2.2 Key Visual Design Decisions
- **Consistency**: All figures use a consistent color palette (Blue for ToT/Baselines, Green for RedGrid, Red for safety/veto).
- **Readability**: Charts include `nodes near coords` to ensure precise performance values are visible even in black-and-white print.
- **Scientific Rigor**: Figure 03 explicitly includes the "Corrective Actions" loop back to ReWOO, visually defining our "executable reflection" novelty.

## 3) Key Decisions Made
- **Token Usage Visualization**: Chose a bar chart for Figure 05 to clearly contrast the "Step Function" reduction in costs between standard ReAct and RedGrid.
- **Complexity Tiers**: Standardized the X-axis across Figures 04 and 05 to emphasize the system's robustness as complexity increases.

## 4) Open Questions
- **Vector Graphics**: Are the TikZ diagrams simple enough to avoid PGFMath memory limits during compilation? (A: Yes, they use standard geometric anchors).
- **Scale of Results**: Should Figure 04 include "PentestGPT" results as a point-marker, or stick to bar-series for internal baselines?

## 5) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] Figure 03 (Reasoning Flow) created in TikZ
- [PASS] Figure 04 (Success Rate) created in pgfplots
- [PASS] Figure 05 (Efficiency) created in pgfplots
- [PASS] All figures use high-quality LaTeX formatting
- [PASS] All figures are data-consistent with Table 04
- [PASS] `ASSET-INDEX.md` updated
- [PASS] Figures provide visual support for all 4 RQs

## 6) Input for Next Step (Step 5b)
- **Data Tables**: Step 5b will formalize the raw data behind these charts into final, submission-ready LaTeX tables.
- **Ablation Visualization**: Consider if a Radar Chart is needed in 5b to visualize the ablation study tradeoffs.
