# [STEP 6d] — Methodology — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step finalized the technical core of the manuscript by expanding the Methodology section (§4) and spinning off the Threat Model (§3) into its own standalone section. We provided deep technical descriptions of the composite reasoning suite, covering the ToT search space, ReWOO symbolic variables, and the closed-loop operational logic of the Reflexion engine. This ensured the methodology is fully reproducible and meets the rigor required for an IEEE S&P submission.

## 2) Full Output

### 2.1 Finalized Threat Model (§3)
- Adversary Profile: AI-augmented red team with long-horizon reasoning.
- Trust Boundaries: Formal distinction between the internal Reasoning Suite and the external Target Infrastructure.
- Safety Gate: Risk-based authorization policy $P$.
- Integrated `figure-01-threat-model.tex`.

### 2.2 Finalized Methodology (§4)
- **Stateful Orchestration**: Described the LangGraph DAG and state persistence ($S_t$).
- **ToT Strategy**: Detailed the $N$-candidate search and 5-heuristic scoring function ($V_s$).
- **ReWOO Planning**: Explained decoupled blueprints and symbolic tool dependency (#E1).
- **Executable Reflection**: Defined the "Closed-Loop" mechanism for converting critiqued observations into operational tool actions.
- Integrated `figure-02`, `figure-03`, and `algorithm-01`.

## 3) Key Decisions Made
- **Symbolic Variable Emphasis**: Highlighted symbolic execution in ReWOO to differentiate RedGrid from simpler ReAct-based planners.
- **Section Splitting**: Decided to split Threat Model and Methodology into separate sections to improve readability and adhere to standard security conference structure.
- **Reproducibility Focus**: Added specific details about the LangGraph DAG and Redis/PostgreSQL state management to ensure the system architecture is replicable.

## 4) Open Questions
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Is the ToT search described as a "search space" mathematically rigorous enough?
- **Worker Registry**: Should we list all 6 worker agents (Web, Auth, etc.) in the methodology, or keep them as high-level "Specialized Agents"? (Decision: Kept high-level for the core section, detailed in Fig 02).

## 5) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
- [PASS] Methodology is fully reproducible from this section alone
- [PASS] All planned figures for this section (01, 02, 03) referenced via `\input{}`
- [PASS] Algorithm 01 referenced via `\ref{}`
- [PASS] Every design decision is justified (e.g., stateful graph for persistence)
- [PASS] Methodology consistent with codebase findings from Step 1
- [PASS] Methodology directly addresses the threat model from 6c
- [PASS] No hand-waving — ToT, ReWOO, and Reflexion logic explained in detail
- [PASS] No inline figure or table code — asset files only
- [PASS] No placeholder text anywhere

## 6) Input for Next Step (Step 6e)
- **Experimental Mapping**: Step 6e (Evaluation) must directly map back to the 5 heuristics and the 3 reasoning components described here.
- **Metric Verification**: Use the SR and TE data to prove the effectiveness of the architecture described in 6d.
