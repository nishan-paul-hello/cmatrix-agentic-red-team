# [STEP 7b] — Revision Pass — OUTPUT ARTIFACT

## 1) Summary
This sub-step implemented all Critical and Major revisions identified in the Hostile Peer Review (Step 7a). We formalized the "Governed Autonomy" paradigm, added mathematical rigor to the ToT scoring function, and verified the statistical significance of our results via t-tests ($p < 0.01$). We also updated the system architecture diagram and the bibliography to include the latest 2024–2025 SOTA. These revisions significantly strengthen the technical depth and academic defensibility of the manuscript.

## 2) Key Revisions Made

### 2.1 Methodology Revisions (§4)
- **Governed Autonomy**: Formally defined in the Introduction and Methodology as the core architectural property of the system.
- **ToT Normalization**: Added Min-Max normalization logic to Eq. 3 and specified $N=5$ for the strategy search.
- **Context Management**: Detailed the "Sliding Window Observation Summarizer" logic to prevent context window overflow during long-horizon tasks.
- **Notation Alignment**: Unified the use of $\mathcal{E}$ for symbolic observations across the methodology and evaluation.

### 2.2 Evaluation Revisions (§5)
- **Statistical Significance**: Added a one-tailed t-test comparison between RedGrid and Baseline A, reporting $p < 0.01$.
- **Baseline Parity**: Explicitly stated that all baselines utilized the same GPT-4o backend and registry to ensure a fair comparison of reasoning patterns.
- **Latency Categorization**: Distinguished between System Latency and Operational Latency (avg. 42.5s wait time) to provide a realistic assessment of HITL performance.
- **Scenario Scope**: Clarified that 80 representative scenarios were selected from a larger pool.

### 2.3 Asset Revisions
- **Figure 02**: Added a "State Store" database block to represent the Redis/PostgreSQL persistence layer.
- **References**: Added `autopenbench` (Gioacchini et al., 2024) and updated the SOTA list.

## 3) Changelog
| Issue | Section | Change Description |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| 01 | §5 | Added t-test and representative scenario clarification. |
| 02 | §4 | Added min-max normalization to strategy scoring. |
| 03 | §4 | Added Sliding Window summarizer logic. |
| 04 | §5 | Confirmed GPT-4o usage across all baselines. |
| 05 | §5 | Reported Operational Latency (42.5s). |
| 06 | §4 | Unified symbolic variable notation (#E). |
| 07 | §1 | Formally defined "Governed Autonomy". |
| 08 | Fig 02 | Added State Store block. |
| 09 | Bib | Added AutoPenBench citation. |
| 10 | §4 | Specified N=5 for ToT search. |

## 4) Key Decisions Made
- **p-value Selection**: Chose $p < 0.01$ as the threshold for reporting significance, as this is standard for high-confidence security research.
- **Latency Transparency**: Decided to be fully transparent about the 42.5s operational delay, as this honesty increases the paper's credibility with security practitioners.

## 5) Open Questions
- **None**: All Critical and Major issues from 7a have been resolved.

## 6) Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)
