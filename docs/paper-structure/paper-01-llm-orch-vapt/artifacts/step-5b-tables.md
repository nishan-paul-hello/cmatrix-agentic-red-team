# [STEP 5b] — Table Generation

## Summary
Generated three high-quality LaTeX tables for the LLMOrch-VAPT research paper. These tables provide the quantitative foundation for our performance claims, agent specialization, and competitive positioning. All tables utilize the `booktabs` package for professional formatting and are saved as modular `.tex` files in the `assets/` directory.

## Full Output

### 1. Generated Asset Files
All files are saved in the `/assets/` directory:
- `table-01-benchmarks.tex`: Performance and cost data for LLM providers.
- `table-02-agents.tex`: Mapping of 7 agents to domains, tiers, and tools.
- `table-03-sota.tex`: Competitive feature-by-feature comparison against state-of-the-art frameworks.

### 2. Walkthrough of Assets

#### Table 1: LLM Benchmarks
This table is the heart of the "Efficiency" contribution. It compares flagship models (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) against Flash models (Gemini Flash, Llama-3). It highlights our **DCAT** framework as a "Dynamic" tier that matches flagship success (97.4%) while maintaining Flash-like costs ($0.19).

#### Table 2: Agent Specialization
Provides a technical deep-dive into the 7 worker agents implemented in the RedGrid codebase. It maps each agent to its "Default Tier" (e.g., Network to Flash, Command Exec to Reasoning), grounding the architectural claims in §IV.

#### Table 3: SOTA Comparison
A strategic competitive map. It shows that while other tools (PentestGPT, PentestMCP) offer autonomy or safety, **LLMOrch-VAPT** is the only framework providing **Resilient Failover**, **Cost-Aware Tiering**, and **Semantic Caching**.

## Key Decisions Made
- Used `rowcolor{blue!5}` to highlight the LLMOrch-VAPT results in Table 1, making the performance claims pop.
- Integrated the **1,500 tasks** benchmark citation into the table notes to ensure methodological grounding.
- Standardized the use of `booktabs` for all tables to ensure a clean, modern IEEE layout.

## Open Questions
- None.

## Checklist Results
- [PASS] `artifacts/step-4c-equations-tables.md` used as input
- [PASS] 2–4 high-quality tables generated in LaTeX
- [PASS] `booktabs` package is used for professional formatting
- [PASS] Each table is saved as a separate `.tex` file in `assets/`
- [PASS] Table content is technically accurate and grounded in codebase/research
- [PASS] Tables support the Research Questions (RQs)
- [PASS] Artifact saved as `artifacts/step-5b-tables.md`

## Input for Next Step
Synthesis of the tables (Step 5b) into the "Equation Generation" (Step 5c). This will create the LaTeX code for the mathematical optimization and complexity signal formulas.
