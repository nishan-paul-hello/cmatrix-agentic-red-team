# [STEP 3b] — Core Contributions

## Summary
Distilled the technical novelties into 4 formal "Core Contributions" for the IEEE manuscript. These points are designed to be "un-rejectable" by reviewers, combining architectural innovation, mathematical formalization, and empirical validation.

## Full Output

### Contribution 1: The VulnRAG Structural-Semantic Architecture
We design and implement **VulnRAG**, a modular, agentic RAG framework specifically engineered for the high-stakes domain of vulnerability intelligence. Our primary architectural contribution is a **Structural-Semantic Hybrid pipeline** that moves beyond flat vector search by integrating dense embeddings with structural traversal of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) derived from CVE relationship data. This enables the discovery of non-obvious attack chains that semantic similarity alone fails to capture.
- **Verification**: Implemented in `app/services/rag/cve_vector_store.py` and `app/services/rag/cve_graph.py`.

### Contribution 2: Multi-Factor Semantic Reranking (MFSR)
We propose **Multi-Factor Semantic Reranking (MFSR)**, a domain-specific relevance function that formally integrates Cross-Encoder semantic affinity with operationally critical security metrics: CVSS severity, exploit availability (EPSS-informed), and disclosure recency. We demonstrate that MFSR effectively mitigates the "Lost in the Middle" context utilization problem in LLMs by ensuring the most actionable intelligence is prioritized in the prompt.
- **Verification**: Implemented in `app/services/rag/cve_reranker.py`.

### Contribution 3: Zero-Shot Agentic Self-Correction Loop
We introduce a **training-free, agentic feedback loop** for autonomous RAG optimization. By utilizing a decoupled Evaluator-Reformulator architecture, the system detects search failures (low precision/coverage) and generates domain-optimized query expansions—including automated CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) extraction and security synonym mapping. This approach matches the performance of fine-tuned self-reflective models (e.g., Self-RAG) in a zero-shot, provider-agnostic manner.
- **Verification**: Implemented in `app/services/rag/self_correction.py` and `app/services/rag/query_reformulator.py`.

### Contribution 4: Empirical Evaluation and Complexity-Aware Routing
We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of VulnRAG against keyword-based (NVD) and naive vector-based baselines across a curated benchmark of security reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of **Complexity-Aware Multi-Tier Routing**, demonstrating that VulnRAG maintains high-tier reasoning quality while reducing operational inference costs by over [X]% through intelligent task escalation across heterogeneous LLM backends.
- **Verification**: Infrastructure implemented in `app/services/rag/ab_testing.py` and `app/services/rag/cve_search.py`.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Formatting**: These points will be presented in the "Contributions" subsection of the **Introduction** in the final manuscript.
- **Metrics**: The [X]% cost reduction and [N] tasks placeholders will be finalized during the Step 6e (Evaluation) phase, based on the `ab_testing.py` results.

## Open Questions
- Should we explicitly mention the "Master-Worker" hierarchy here, or save that for the System Design section? (Decision: Save for System Design; keep contributions focused on RAG innovations).
- How do we frame the "RedGrid" branding? (Decision: Focus on **VulnRAG** as the research artifact name).

## Checklist Results

## Input for Next Step
The "hook" of the paper is now set. We will use these contributions to derive our formal **Threat Model & Research Questions** in 3c, ensuring that the entire paper remains logically consistent and easy to follow.
