## ABSTRACT 

AI agents have significant potential to reshape cybersecurity, making a thorough assessment of their capabilities critical. However, existing evaluations fall short, because they are based on small-scale benchmarks and only measure static outcomes, failing to capture the full, dynamic range of real-world security challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities across 188 software projects. Adjustable to different vulnerability analysis settings, CyberGym primarily tasks agents with generating a proof-of-concept test that reproduces a vulnerability, given only its text description and the corresponding codebase. Our extensive evaluation highlights that CyberGym effectively differentiates agents’ and models’ cybersecurity capabilities. Even the top-performing combinations only achieve a _∼_ 20% success rate, demonstrating the overall difficulty of CyberGym. Beyond static benchmarking, we show that CyberGym leads to the discovery of 34 zero-day vulnerabilities and 18 historically incomplete patches. These results underscore that CyberGym is not only a robust benchmark for measuring AI’s progress in cybersecurity but also a platform for creating direct, real-world security impact. 

## 1 INTRODUCTION 

Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming remarkably capable at real-world software engineering tasks (Jimenez et al., 2024; Mündler et al., 2024), thanks to their strong reasoning and tool-use abilities (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Anthropic). This growing capability has significant implications for the critical domain of cybersecurity, presenting both opportunities and risks (Guo et al., 2025). Therefore, it is both critical and urgent to rigorously assess AI agents’ cybersecurity capabilities. Recently, several useful cybersecurity benchmarks have been developed. Some are based on classic capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges (Zhang et al., 2025b; Shao et al., 2024), while others leverage historical vulnerabilities from real software projects (Carlini et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Lee et al., 2025). However, they suffer from two key limitations: 

- (i) They are small-scale (up to 200 instances, see Table 1), due to relying on significant manual benchmark building effort or brittle data sources. This small scale can lead to unstable evaluations and may not capture the full range of complexities in practical cybersecurity. 

- (ii) Their evaluation results are solely focused on static benchmark instances, making it difficult to determine how AI agents impact constantly evolving, current cybersecurity landscape. 

**CyberGym: A Large-Scale, Realistic Cybersecurity Benchmark** To address limitation (i), we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and realistic cybersecurity benchmark<sup>1</sup> . As illustrated in Figure 1, CyberGym contains 1,507 benchmark instances derived from real-world vulnerabilities across 188 widely used software projects spanning diverse domains. These vulnerabilities are sourced from OSS-Fuzz (Google), Google’s continuous fuzzing service. We ensure the quality and timeliness of our benchmark instances through systematic automated filters and manual validation. 

CyberGym primarily evaluates agents on their ability to reproduce vulnerabilities, a key task in software security that often challenges even human experts (Böhme et al., 2017; Klees et al., 2018;

Figure 1: CyberGym includes 1,507 instances from real-world vulnerabilities across 188 diverse projects. For benchmarking, AI agents receive vulnerability descriptions and pre-patch codebased to generate proof-of-concept (PoC) tests for vulnerability reproduction. Going a step further, CyberGym creates direct security impact via detecting incomplete patches and zero-day vulnerabilities. 

Mu et al., 2018). As shown in Figure 1, given a text description of a vulnerability and the associated codebase, agents must produce a proof-of-concept (PoC) test to reproduce it, i.e., to demonstrate the existence of the target vulnerability. We rigorously validate generated PoCs by executing them on both pre-patch and post-patch versions to confirm reproduction success. Solving CyberGym requires agents to perform deep reasoning across large codebases, spanning thousands of files and millions lines of code. They must locate relevant code sections and produce effective PoCs of diverse formats and sizes to trigger the vulnerability. Beyond the main task, CyberGym supports different difficulty levels that simulate various stages of the vulnerability lifecycle, including discovering vulnerabilities exploratively or reproducing them given additional patch information to simulate real-world one-day scenarios. CyberGym’s modular, containerized design ensures reproducible, extensible, and scalable evaluation, allowing for easy assessment of future agents and integration of new benchmark instances. 

**CyberGym Challenges Frontier Agents with a Ladder of Difficulty** We conduct an extensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art agent frameworks and eleven frontier LLMs on CyberGym. Our results highlight that CyberGym is a challenging benchmark that effectively differentiates these approaches based on their cybersecurity capabilities. The best-performing combination (if no “thinking” mechanism is enabled) is OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025) with Claude-Sonnet-4 (Anthropic, c), which achieves only a 17.9% success rate. We also show that turning on “thinking” improves Claude-Sonnet-4 only slightly, but significantly for GPT-5 (OpenAI, b), which jumps from a 7.7% to a 22.0% success rate. Specialized software engineering models (Pan et al., 2024; Jain et al., 2025; All Hands AI Team) exhibit poor generalization on CyberGym, with _≤_ 2.0% success rates, demonstrating CyberGym’s complementary nature to SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024). Our in-depth analysis shows that current approaches mainly solve simpler tasks requiring fewer agent execution steps and shorter PoCs. These results indicate that CyberGym’s diverse and challenging tasks provide a gradual ladder of difficulty, enabling tracking current and future progress in the cybersecurity field. 

**CyberGym Extends to Creating Direct, Real-World Security Impact** Beyond benchmarking, CyberGym produces a direct impact on practical security, addressing limitation (ii). During our evaluation, we found that even when tasked with reproducing a specific vulnerability, the agents can inadvertently generate PoCs that trigger different vulnerabilities. These unintended PoCs affect program versions where the target vulnerability has been patched, or even the latest version. Our analysis of these PoCs reveal 17 inadequate historical patches and 10 previously unknown vulnerabilities, i.e., zero-days. To further validate this capability, we deploy the agents for open-ended vulnerability discovery across 431 open-source projects, identifying an additional 25 unique zero-day vulnerabilities. We have responsibly disclosed all zero-days to project maintainers, with 4 CVE assignments received and 10 vulnerabilities patched as of this writing. 

**Main Contributions** In summary, we make the following key contributions: 

- A large-scale and realistic cybersecurity benchmark with diverse and challenging benchmark instances and rigorous execution-based metrics (Section 3). 

- A comprehensive evaluation for various frontier agents and LLMs with over $40,000 USD API credits and 1,000 H100 GPU hours, providing valuable insights into the emerging capabilities and current limitations of AI agents in cybersecurity (Section 4). 

- A platform performing open-ended vulnerability discovery analysis, demonstrating the substantial practical security impact of AI agents on real-world software (Section 5). 

- The discovery and disclosure of 34 zero-days in popular open-source projects (Appendix E).

## 2 RELATED WORK 

**Cybersecurity Benchmarks for AI Agents** We now compare CyberGym with recent cybersecurity benchmarks, as detailed in Table 1. These benchmarks’ scope can be split into two categories: capturethe-flag (CTF) problems and those based on real-world projects. Earlier benchmarks like NYU CTF Bench (Shao et al., 2024) and Cybench (Zhang et al., 2025b) rely exclusively on CTF problems. Because CTFs are designed in idealized settings, they often fail to capture real-world complexities. Recognizing this, the community has shifted towards leveraging real-world projects. This includes AutoAdvExBench (Carlini et al., 2025), CVE-Bench (Zhu et al., 2025), BountyBench (Zhang et al., 2025a), SEC-Bench (Lee et al., 2025), and our own CyberGym. 

CyberGym stands out in both scale and diversity. With 1,507 instances, it is over seven times larger than any other cybersecurity benchmark. Furthermore, these instances are derived from 188 software projects from diverse application domains, as listed in Table 5. This ensures that CyberGym effectively measures progress by capturing a wide range of difficulties, as demonstrated by the gradually improved performance of frontier models in our evaluation (Section 4). 

Another key differentiator for our work is its in-depth analysis on agents’ ability to discover new, zero-day vulnerabilities (Section 5). While all other benchmarks focus solely on known, historical vulnerabilities, our zero-day findings move beyond and produce direct, real-world security impact.

**Coding Benchmarks for AI Agents** Existing coding benchmarks such as SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024) and SWT-bench (Mündler et al., 2024) evaluate AI agents’ ability to handle software engineering tasks. SWE-bench provides agents with a codebase and an issue description, instructing them to generate a pull request to solve the issue. SWT-bench provides the same inputs but tasks agents with writing unit tests to validate a ground truth pull request. These benchmarks have sparked the development of various coding agents, such as OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025) and Codex (OpenAI), as well as specialized backbone models like SWE-Gym (Pan et al., 2024) and R2E-Gym (Jain et al., 2025), which are fine-tuned to achieve high performance on SWE-bench. 

While CyberGym can be seen as a coding benchmark, it focuses specifically on security, in contrast to the functionality-focused nature of SWE-bench and SWT-bench. SWE-bench and SWT-bench often involve making localized code changes, whereas CyberGym requires more comprehensive, repository-wide reasoning. To succeed on CyberGym, an agent must craft a proof of concept input that accurately navigates from the program’s entry point to the vulnerability, demanding a deep understanding of the entire codebase. Due to these differences, general-purpose software agents and LLMs specially fine-tuned for software engineering tasks struggle on CyberGym, as evidenced by our evaluation results in Section 4. This highlights CyberGym’s complementary value to existing coding benchmarks such as SWE-bench and its importance for a more complete agent evaluation. 

## 3 CYBERGYM BENCHMARK 

### 3.1 PRELIMINARIES 

**Vulnerabilities and Program Versions** Our CyberGym benchmark leverages historical vulnerabilities found and patched in real-world software. These programs, hosted on platforms like GitHub, have multiple versions, with each commit potentially patching or introducing new vulnerabilities. This creates a dynamic landscape where the number of vulnerabilities changes across different program versions. A security patch fixes a specific vulnerability, so that vulnerability exists in the program’s 

3 

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 

pre-patch version but is resolved in the post-patch version, assuming the patch is complete. Moreover, the latest program version might contain unknown, zero-day vulnerabilities. 

**Sanitizers as Vulnerability Detection Oracle** Sanitizers are powerful tools that determine if test executions trigger certain classes of security vulnerabilities, such as memory safety issues (Serebryany et al., 2012; Stepanov & Serebryany, 2015) and undefined behaviors (LLVM, b). Widely used by state-of-the-art software testing tools and cybersecurity competitions (Michal Zalewski; Google; DARPA), sanitizers serve as our oracle as well. Mainstream compilers like GCC and Clang (GNU; LLVM, a) have built-in support for sanitizers, which can be enabled with compiler flags. When a program is compiled with sanitizers, it is instrumented with runtime checks at potentially unsafe locations, such as memory operations. As the program runs with tests, these checks monitor execution and intentionally crashes the program with a detailed error report if a vulnerability is triggered. 

**Fuzzing and OSS-Fuzz** Fuzzing (Miller et al., 1990; Michal Zalewski) is an important automated testing technique that feeds a high volume of random inputs into a program. It then monitors the program behavior to detect vulnerabilities, often with the help of sanitizers. OSS-Fuzz (Google) is Google’s continuous fuzzing service that has discovered over 13,000 vulnerabilities across more than 1,000 critical open-source projects since its launch in 2016. For each vulnerability found, OSS-Fuzz generates a PoC, reports it to developers, and continuously monitors the project to validate whether the vulnerability has been successfully patched. This makes OSS-Fuzz an excellent data source of historical vulnerabilities for CyberGym. ARVO (Mei et al., 2024) is a valuable infrastructure that collects vulnerabilities found by OSS-Fuzz in reusable Docker images. However, ARVO itself does not define any evaluation tasks or metrics, meaning it cannot serve as a benchmark on its own. 

**Scope, Rationale, and Limitations** CyberGym targets memory safety vulnerabilities in widelydistributed C/C++ projects that are detectable through sanitizers. This scope is chosen for several reasons. First, memory safety vulnerabilities are critical security issues that are both frequent and dangerous in practice, representing more than 70% of high-severity vulnerabilities in industry reports from Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla (Chromium; MSRC, 2019; Hosfelt, 2019). Second, memory safety has been extensively studied in traditional security research (Szekeres et al., 2013; Baldoni et al., 2018; Fioraldi et al., 2020). This yields reliable tools useful for agent evaluation: sanitizers as reliable vulnerability detection oracle and OSS-Fuzz (Google) as a large-scale corpus of real-world historical vulnerabilities. However, our focus on memory safety issues limits us to primarily C/C++ codebases, which may not capture the full landscape of security vulnerabilities. We discuss extensions toward broader vulnerability classes and cybersecurity stages in Section 6. 

### 3.2 TASK FORMULATION 

**Task Input and Output** In CyberGym’s primary evaluation task, the agent is given a text description of a historically found vulnerability and the corresponding codebase before the vulnerability gets patched. The description includes various information about the vulnerability useful for reproduction, such as the approximate location, type, and root cause. Examples of descriptions are provided in Figures 1 and 8. The agent is tasked to create a PoC to reproduce the target vulnerability, i.e., validate that the specific vulnerability exists in the given codebase. Besides source code, we provide an executable of the pre-patch program in a modular, containerized environment. The agent can submit the PoC to this environment via a bash script, receive execution feedback such as exit code and command line output, and iteratively refine the PoC accordingly. We choose this reproduction task because it is a critical but challenging task in software security. Human security experts require approximately 5 hours to reproduce known vulnerabilities from public reports (Mu et al., 2018), with significantly longer times when no usable PoC is available. Furthermore, even automated fuzzing tools take a median of 324 days to reveal vulnerabilities in real-world OSS-Fuzz projects (Keller et al., 2023), underscoring the inherent difficulty of triggering a crash on these vulnerabilities. 

**Execution-Based Evaluation Metrics** Another reason for choosing reproduction as our main task is that its success can be reliably determined with execution. Specifically, we execute generated PoCs against both pre-patch and post-patch versions of the target program with sanitizers enabled. For a PoC to be considered successful, we require that (i) it triggers a sanitizer crash in the pre-patch version and (ii) running it on the post-patch version does not produce any sanitizer crash. This means that the generated PoC accurately reproduces the specific vulnerability that the patch addresses. We also

provide the post-patch executables in a containerized environment for ease of use. Our benchmark metric is the success rate: the percentage of instances where the agent generates successful PoCs. 

**Different Levels of Difficulty** CyberGym includes various types of supplementary information for each benchmark instance. They can be formulated as additional inputs to the agent, creating various levels of task difficulty beyond our primary task, from least to most informative: 

- Level 0: We provide the pre-patch codebase, but not the text description of the target vulnerability. This establishes an open-ended vulnerability discovery setting where the agent is free to find any vulnerability in the codebase and create the corresponding PoC. This explorative setting serves as a baseline to see whether agents can trigger the target vulnerability even without prior knowledge. We also leverage this setting in Section 5 for large-scale zero-day discovery. 

- Level 1: We provide the pre-patch codebase and the text description, i.e., our primary task setting. Community vulnerability reports such as CVEs often only provide textual vulnerability descriptions without working PoCs (Mu et al., 2018). To reproduce these vulnerabilities, security researchers must reconstruct PoCs from these descriptions, which costs significant effort. Level 1 evaluates whether AI agents can bridge the gap between textual vulnerability reports and working PoCs. 

- Level 2: CyberGym includes a ground truth PoC for each benchmark instance (discussed in Section 3.3). In addition to the inputs from level 1, we provide the crash stack trace obtained from executing the ground truth PoC on the pre-patch program. According to the survey by Mu et al. (2018), information about "the exact location of the vulnerable code" was deemed necessary for a vulnerability report to be complete. The crash stack traces emulate the scenario by supplying additional context (e.g., function names, source files, line numbers).Level 2 evaluates whether agents can leverage these location details to more effectively construct working PoCs. 

- Level 3: In addition to level 2, we provide the agent with the ground truth patch in the diff format and the post-patch codebase. This offers additional semantic insights about the target vulnerability and simulates realistic one-day settings, where patches exist but have not yet been widely deployed. The security patches released by vendors reveal vulnerability details through code diffs. Attackers routinely perform patch analysis to reverse-engineer vulnerabilities and craft PoCs targeting unpatched systems, which has been extensively studied for decades (Oh, 2009; Duan et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Level 3 tests whether agents can automate this patch-to-exploit process, which is critical for both red teams to assess defensive robustness and blue teams to understand residual exposure before patches are deployed. 

### 3.3 BENCHMARK CONSTRUCTION 

**Sourcing from OSS-Fuzz** The lifecycle of a vulnerabil- **Vul. code Fixed code** ✔ **Patch commit** ity detected by OSS-Fuzz is illustrated in Figure 2. Project **Day 0: Vul. found** updates in OSS-Fuzz occur daily, and the patch commit **Day 1: Vul. still existed and reported** exists in the last day before OSS-Fuzz identifies a fixed vulnerability. We pinpoint the exact patch commit by performing a binary search through the commits in the last day to find the first commit where the PoC no longer trig✔ gers a vulnerability. With the identified patch commit, we can obtain CyberGym’s benchmark elements: the pre- **Day n-1:Vul. still existed Patch range Day n: Fixed** patch codebase, the post-patch codebase, the ground truth Figure 2: OSS-Fuzz lifecycle. PoC produced by OSS-Fuzz, and the ground truth patch. The codebases are then compiled to executables with sanitizers enabled. The patch commit’s message may contain detailed information of the vulnerability, such as the location, type, and root cause. We prompt GPT-4.1 to rephrase the commit message to obtain a description of the vulnerability. 

**Quality Assurance** We apply various automated and manual filters to improve CyberGym’s quality: 

- _Ensuring informative description_ : We remove instances where the patch commit’s message does not provide sufficient information about the vulnerability, e.g., its approximate location and root cause. We also filter out cases where the commit message describes more than one fixed issues. We identify these low-quality cases using GPT-4.1 as a judge and improve the judging robustness by incorporating manually inspected cases as few-shot examples. Human verification on a subset of 300 instances shows 96% precision, demonstrating the effectiveness of our filtering pipeline and the high quality of CyberGym (detailed in Appendix C).

- _Validating reproducibility_ : We re-run the ground truth PoC on the pre-patch and post-patch executables to ensure that the vulnerability can be reproduced. 

- _Removing redundancy and ambiguity_ : We exclude cases where multiple instances refer to the same patch commit and executables with similar logic, identified by comparing their crash stack traces. 

- All the prompts we use for rephrasing and filtering are presented in Appendix C. 

**Benchmark Scale and Diversity** Our final dataset includes 1,507 vulnerabilities disclosed between January 1, 2017, and April 21, 2025. Of these, 1,368 instances are sourced from ARVO dataset (Mei et al., 2024) (up to July 31, 2024) and filtered through our quality-assurance pipeline before inclusion. We further collect 139 more recent vulnerabilities, improving the timeliness of CyberGym and enabling an analysis that shows no strong effect of data contamination on CyberGym (Section 4). In Appendix B, we present details of CyberGym, highlighting its diversity across multiple dimensions. This diversity is crucial for creating a ladder of benchmark difficulty. Our evaluation in Section 4 confirms this, as more capable models solve more CyberGym instances. We provide a summary of these details next. 

Table 3 shows key statistics of CyberGym: (i) the vulnerability descriptions contain sufficient information for reproduction but have varied granularity, with a median length of 24 words, while a few reach up to 158 words; (ii) the ground truth PoCs exhibit significant size variation, ranging from several bytes to over 1 MB, reflecting the diversity of input formats and attack vectors across different executable types; (iii) the codebases are substantial, with a median of 1,117 files and 387,491 lines of code, spanning from tens of thousands to millions of lines of code across projects; (iv) patches demonstrate considerable variability in scope and complexity, typically consisting of small security fixes such as boundary or value checks that modify a median of 1 file and 7 lines of code, yet in more complex cases requiring extensive changes that can span up to 40 files and 3,456 lines. 

As shown in Table 5, CyberGym covers a total of 188 projects. These projects span diverse application domains, including networks (e.g., cURL), cryptography (e.g., OpenSSL), programming tools (e.g., GNU Binutils), scientific computing (e.g., OSGeo), operating systems (e.g., QEMU), and multimedia (e.g., FFmpeg). These projects are also highly popular, attracting thousands of GitHub stars, with the most prominent, OpenCV, reaching over 80,000 stars. The distribution of benchmark instances among these projects forms a long tail, with 62.4% of instances drawn from projects outside the top 10. Projects with multiple benchmark instances, such as GNU Binutils and FFmpeg, include many submodules and produce distinct executables with varying code and functionalities. 

Table 4 shows that the benchmark encompasses 28 distinct sanitizer crash types, including critical and frequently encountered issues such as buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences. 

## 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 

We present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agents and LLMs on CyberGym. Overall, the results show that CyberGym presents a significant challenge for current agents and models. It also provides a clear ladder of difficulties (e.g., Figure 7), differentiating agents’ and models’ cybersecurity skills, which will be useful for progress tracking. 

Evaluating state-of-the-art agents and LLMs in non-thinking mode on full CyberGym requires approximately $3,000 in API credits. To enable more lightweight and budget-friendly evaluations, we also provide a randomly selected subset of 300 instances ( _∼_ 20% of the entire benchmark). More details about experimental setup, including prompts, compute, agent configurations, and model versions, are provided in Appendix C. Specific setups and results for each experiment are discussed separately. Unless explicitly specified, we use difficulty level 1 (our primary reproduction task). 

**Backbone LLMs Differ Significantly in Reproduction Success Rate** We select eleven state-ofthe-art LLMs from three categories: (i) General-purpose closed-source LLMs: GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, a), GPT-5 (OpenAI, b), o4-mini (OpenAI, c), Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Anthropic, b), Claude-Sonnet4 (Anthropic, c), and Gemini-2.5-Flash (Google AI Team); (ii) General-purpose open-weight LLMs: Qwen3-235B-A22B (Qwen Team) and DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2024); (iii) Specialized LLMs optimized for OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025) to solve SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024): SWEGym-32B (Pan et al., 2024), R2E-Gym-32B (Jain et al., 2025), and OpenHands-LM-32B (All Hands AI Team). In this experiment, we disable the thinking mode to reduce cost in this experiment, except

for o4-mini, which does not support disabling thinking, and GPT-5, for which minimal reasoning effort is used. We adopt OpenHands as the agent scaffold (Wang et al., 2025) of these LLMs with a maximum of 100 iterations per task. 

Overall, Claude-Sonnet-4 achieves the best result with a success rate of 17.9%, followed by Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1. Specialized models such as SWE-Gym-32B, R2E-Gym-32B, and OpenHands-LM-32B, despite their strong result on SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024), demonstrate poor generalization on CyberGym, with success rates _≤_ 2.0%. Figure 3 illustrates the results of different LLMs. This demonstrates the complementarity between SWE-bench and CyberGym. Notably, o4-mini shows a relatively low sucClaude-Sonnet-4 17.9 cess rate. Upon further inspection, we found Claude-3.7-Sonnet 11.9 that o4-mini often conservatively requests user GPT-4.1 9.4 confirmation and prematurely terminates the GPT-5 (minimal) 7.8 execution.We do not observe this pattern in Gemini-2.5-Flash 4.8 other models, highlighting the need for agent DeepSeek-V3 3.6 developers to handle such model-specific beo4-mini 2.5 haviors to maximize agent utility and robustR2E-Gym-32B 2.0 ness. The union of all results yields a 27.2% Qwen3-235B-A22B 1.9 success rate, revealing the low overlap in the OpenHands-LM-32B 1.7 tasks successfully completed by different modSWE-Gym-32B 0.1 els. Additional results in Appendix D show 0.0 6.0Level 1 Success Rate (%)12.0 18.0 that balanced resampling across projects and Figure 3: Results of various LLMs with OpenHands. crash types maintains consistent conclusions. 

**Thinking Mode Improves Success Rate** We compare Level 1 Success Rate (%) thinking and non-thinking modes using Qwen3-235Bw/o Thinking A22B, GPT-5, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Claude-Sonnet-4 24.0 w/ Thinking on the 300-instance subset.

As illus8.0 2.7 4.7 trated in Figure 4, while the thinking mode yields mod0.0 est gains over other models, it increases GPT-5’s success Qwen3-235B-A22B-A22B Claude rate from 7.7% (with minimal reasoning) to 22.0% (with Figure 4: high reasoning), surpassing Claude-Sonnet-4. This phenomenon is consistent with GPT-5’s results for other benchmarks (OpenAI, b).

**Different Agents Show Distinctive Behaviors Despite Similar Success Rates** We evaluate two general-purpose coding agents, OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025) and OpenAI Codex CLI (OpenAI), alongside two cybersecurity agents for solving CTF problems, EnIGMA (Abramovich et al., 2025) and Cybench agent (Zhang et al., 2025b). We apply maximum budget and iteration constraints that yield an average cost of approximately $2.0 per task for each agent. We use GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, a) as the backbone LLM, because it achieves a strong balance between cost, rate limits, and success rates. 

Figure 5 shows that all four agents achieve similar success rates Level 1 Success Rate (%) 9.0 9.4 overall.across all agents (i.e., treating the task as successful if any sin-However, when considering the union of outcomes 9.06.0 7.2 7.4 gle agent succeeds), the combined success rate reaches 18.4%, nearly doubling the best individual result. This result reveals 3.0 0.0 small success overlap across different agents, highlighting their EnIGMA Codex Cybench OpenHands complementary capabilities. Our further analysis, including deFigure 5: Success rates of different tailed tool usage statistics presented in Figure 17 of Appendix D, agent frameworks using GPT-4.1. reveals distinct behavioral patterns among these agents. OpenHands demonstrates proficiency through more efficient tool calls with command chaining in Bash, whereas CTF-specialized agents rely more heavily on writing scripts such as Python. 

**Limited Impact of Potential Data Contamination** Since LLMs are pre-trained on large-scale internet datasets that may include the codebases and vulnerability reports in CyberGym, we investigate the effect of data contamination. We partition CyberGym based on vulnerability disclosure dates relative to each model’s knowledge cutoff and evaluate performance on the two resulting splits. We conduct this analysis for OpenHands with four LLMs whose post-cutoff split contains more than 50 samples, ensuring sufficient data for robust statistical testing. We compare

The former provides reliable inference for small samples, whereas the latter is standard for large-sample proportion comparisons. The success rates, sample sizes, and the _p_ -values from both tests are reported in Table 2, with additional details in Appendix D. For all evaluated models, the _p_ -values exceed 0.1, indicating no statistically significant difference in success rates between pre- and post-cutoff splits.

**Richer Input Information Enhances Reproduction Effort** As described in Section 3.2, we design four difficulty levels based on the amount of input information provided to the agents. Figure 6 shows how these difficulty levels affect the success rate of Openhands with GPT-4.1. Richer input information, such as stack trace provided in level 2 and ground truth patch provided in level 3, greatly enhances the vulnerability reproduction success rate Success Rate (%) compared to level 1 (our primary task). For level 0, only 3.5% 17.1 instances can be successfully reproduced without access to the 15.0 13.1 text description of the target vulnerability. When restricted to 10.0 9.4 142 vulnerabilities disclosed after GPT-4.1’s knowledge cutoff 5.0 3.5 date, the agent successfully reproduces 5 instances at level 0.0 0, simulating the rediscovery of these vulnerabilities without Level 0 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 prior knowledge.

Figure 6: Success rates of OpenHands with GPT-4.1 under four different levels of task difficulty. 

**Challenges in Handling Longer PoCs** Executables in CyberGym accept various input formats, including text and binary files. A longer ground truth PoC typically implies that the target executable has more complex input parsing logic. This increased complexity makes it more difficult for an agent to generate inputs that accurately trigger the vulnerability conditions. In Figure 7, we present the performance of OpenHands with GPT-4.1 and ClaudeSonnet-4 partitioned by the lengths of ground truth PoCs. Tasks in the [0 _,_ 10) range represent a relatively small input exploration space, where the agent achieves the highest success rate. However, the success rate drops significantly as the ground Level 1 Success Rate (%) 60 55.3 GPT-4.1 truth PoC length increases.cess rate of only around 10% on instances whose ground-truthFor instance, the agents show a suc45 43.5 Claude-Sonnet-4 PoCs are longer than 100 bytes, even though these instances 30 22.9 represent 65.7% of the entire benchmark.

These results together indicate that CyberGym’s Sonnet-4 on instances grouped by diverse benchmark instances create a ladder of difficulties. the lengths of ground truth PoCs. 

**Qualitative Analysis of Agent Behaviors** Figure 8 illustrates an agent (OpenHands with GPT4.1) successfully reproducing a target vulnerability using the provided description and source code. The description specifies the name of the vulnerable function (ReadMNGImage) and the condition required to trigger the vulnerability: the mng_LOOP chunk must be less than 5 bytes in length. The key challenge is crafting an MNG file that maintains a valid signature while creating the target malformed chunk. As shown in Figure 8, the agent begins by searching and browsing the source files (Step 1 to 4) using awk, find, and grep, guided by the keywords in the description. It successfully locates the definition of the ReadMNGImage function, identifies the structure of the mng_LOOP chunk, and discovers a test case file (input.mng) in MNG format. To inspect the content in hexadecimal format, it attempts to use xxd (Step 5). Since xxd is not initially available in the environment, the agent installs it and successfully examines the binary file (Step 6). After gathering the necessary information about the target function and file format, the agent constructs a PoC and tests it (Step 7). When the initial attempt fails with no crash, the agent mutates the PoC by

Note that we only show some of the more interesting steps from the agent trace. 

adding a null byte (Step 8), successfully triggering the target vulnerability, resulting in a crash with AddressSanitizer detecting a Heap-buffer-overflow READ (Step 9). 

In addition to this example, we observe that the agents can build the executable following the instructions in the codebase and performing dynamic testing, rather than just source code inspection. The agents are also capable of writing scripts in Python and Bash to construct more complex PoCs. Common failure patterns of agents include exhausting iteration limits on unproductive attempts, prematurely requesting user information instead of inferring from code, and overwhelming the context window with excessive output (e.g., printing very large files). Additional recurrent patterns, including premature or incorrect success declarations, overly long plaintext PoCs, and repeated retrieval failures, are analyzed in Appendix D. Further successful and unsuccessful examples are presented and analyzed in Appendix F. 

## 5 FROM BENCHMARKING TO DIRECT SECURITY IMPACT 

Beyond benchmarking, we now show that CyberGym extends to creating direct, real-world security impact. Specifically, PoCs generated during our evaluation successfully detect incomplete patches and discover novel zero-day vulnerabilities. Given these promising results, we run agents in an open-ended vulnerability discovery setting (i.e., difficulty level 0 of CyberGym), leading to the discovery of even more zero-days. In total, we identify and confirm 34 zero-day vulnerabilities. We have responsibly disclosed all these vulnerabilities to their project maintainers. We will wait for patches to these vulnerabilities or a 90-day responsible disclosure period before publicly releasing these vulnerabilities. As of this writing, we have received 4 CVE assignments, and 10 vulnerabilities have been patched. A brief summary of these vulnerabilities is presented in Appendix D. 

**PoCs Generated for CyberGym Reveal Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Incomplete Patches** Recall that in CyberGym’s reproduction task, a generated PoC is considered successful if it triggers a sanitizer crash on the pre-patch program version but not on the post-patch version. The groundtruth PoC exhibits the same behavior. Even though CyberGym instructs the agents to reproduce vulnerabilities, we found that they could inadvertently generate PoCs that trigger sanitizer crashes on the post-patch versions. This indicates that, instead of reproducing the original vulnerability, these PoCs trigger a different flaw than the one captured by the ground-truth PoC. Among all PoCs generated in our evaluation (Section 4), we found 759 instances of such crashes across 60 projects. 

These post-patch crashes could reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities that persist beyond the patch and even in the latest versions. To confirm this, we validate the 759 PoCs on the latest versions 

9 

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 

of their programs and find that 35 of them still cause crashes. After manual root cause analysis and deduplication, we identify 9 unique zero-day vulnerabilities that have not been previously reported. We calculate how long these vulnerabilities have existed by measuring the time between the earliest version where we confirm their presence and the latest version. The average duration is 969 days, meaning these zero-days are present for at least that long on average. 

In addition to zero-days, some post-patch crashes may instead signal incomplete patches for the target vulnerability. To confirm this, we compare sanitizer reports from ground truth PoCs on pre-patch version with those from generated PoCs on post-patch versions using fuzzy matching (seatgeek). We then manually inspect highly similar cases to confirm if the two crashes share the same root cause. This process leads to 18 cases of incomplete patches across 15 projects (an example is shown in Appendix D). One of them affects the latest version of the project. To preserve CyberGym ’s benchmark quality, we have updated the post-patch versions in these cases to the first version where the target vulnerabilities are fully addressed. 

**Running Agentic Vulnerability Discovery at Scale** To further investigate agents’ capabilities in finding zero-days, we deploy OpenHands with GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 on the latest versions of projects supported by OSS-Fuzz. Our evaluation encompasses 431 projects containing 1,748 entry executables. We follow our difficulty level 0 setting, where agents receive only the codebase and are instructed to generate PoCs to exploratively identify vulnerabilities. GPT-5 is configured with high reasoning effort, as this configuration achieved the best performance in our experiments detailed in Section 4. GPT-4.1 triggers 16 crashes, while GPT-5 triggers 56 crashes. From these crashes, we manually confirm 7 and 22 unique zero-day vulnerabilities, respectively, with 4 overlapping between the two models. This demonstrates that current agents can already find zero-days, and the superior performance of GPT-5 in this open-ended setting aligns with their better success rate in CyberGym’s reproduction task. This suggests that CyberGym is a reliable proxy for agents’ real-world cybersecurity capabilities. 

## 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

We introduce CyberGym, a realistic and large-scale benchmark designed for evaluating the cybersecurity capabilities of AI agents. CyberGym comprises 1,507 high-quality, diverse instances across 188 open-source projects, creating a ladder of difficulty useful for tracking current and future agent progress. We extensively evaluate 4 agent frameworks and 11 LLMs on CyberGym. Our findings show that CyberGym poses a significant challenge for current AI agents, with the top-performing combination of agent and model achieving only a 22.0% success rate. We also demonstrate that CyberGym extends to creating direct, real-world security impact via uncovering incomplete security patches and identifying 34 new, zero-day vulnerabilities. We believe CyberGym will help deepen the understanding of AI agents’ cybersecurity abilities and contribute to the broader AI safety landscape. 

**Future Work on Benchmark Development** Currently, CyberGym primarily focuses on vulnerabilities in C/C++ projects, specifically those related to memory safety issues. This is due to its reliance on sanitizers for detection. A key area for future development is expanding beyond these boundaries to encompass other vulnerability types, such as logic flaws and cryptographic weaknesses, across different platforms including web and mobile applications, while supporting a broader range of programming languages. Additionally, CyberGym’s current focus on Proof of Concept (PoC) generation provides a strong foundation for benchmarking through vulnerability reproduction and demonstrates real-world security impact. Future work should extend CyberGym’s capabilities to support other critical security tasks, including both defensive measures like patching and offensive ones like exploitation. Incorporating patch evaluation requires addressing the challenge of assessing whether patches preserve original functionality without introducing new vulnerabilities. This involves standardizing heterogeneous test systems across projects, applying reliable vulnerability detection, and generating new test cases. Similarly, developing exploitation evaluation requires fine-grained oracles and detection mechanisms to more precisely characterize exploitation capabilities. 

**Future Work on Agent Development** As demonstrated in Section 4, current agents primarily succeed on tasks with short ground truth PoCs and fewer reasoning steps, while exhibiting complementary capabilities and distinct behavioral patterns. These findings suggest several promising directions: strengthening LLMs’ long-context reasoning capabilities, designing ensemble frameworks that combine agents’ complementary strengths, developing specialized security tools, and optimizing tool usage by adopting the most effective operational patterns identified in our analysis.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 

This material is in part based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant No. 2229876. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation or its federal agency and industry partners. 

## ETHICS STATEMENT 

The use of large language model (LLM) agents in cybersecurity raises important ethical considerations due to their potential for both protective and offensive applications. While our benchmark, CyberGym, is intended for research and evaluation of autonomous cybersecurity agents, it operates in a domain inherently linked to cyber-attack capabilities, requiring responsible design and usage. 

While our benchmark features tasks rooted in vulnerability reproduction and discovery, all benchmark data used in this work is sourced from publicly available repositories, with every vulnerability having been patched at least three months prior to inclusion. This ensures that the dataset does not pose immediate risk to the software ecosystem. During our experiments, we discovered previously unknown vulnerabilities in latest versions of various software projects. In alignment with responsible disclosure practices, all newly identified vulnerabilities have been reported to the respective developers. We will withhold public release of associated proof-of-concept inputs until patches are made available or the standard 90-day disclosure window has elapsed. 

Fuzzing has long been a cornerstone of offensive security strategies and is widely acknowledged as one of the most effective approaches for vulnerability detection. Our benchmark builds upon this principle by assessing LLM agents’ capabilities to reason about and replicate vulnerabilities in a controlled and reproducible manner. By doing so, we aim to support research and development in automated vulnerability analysis and security auditing, contributing to long-term improvements in software security. 

Despite the potential for dual-use, we believe that CyberGym serves a constructive role in cybersecurity. It enables rigorous evaluation of AI agents under realistic conditions, helping to reveal existing limitations and inform future development. As LLM agents grow more capable, ensuring their alignment, controllability, and security awareness becomes increasingly important. Our results show that even state-of-the-art agents struggle with complex vulnerability reproduction tasks, underscoring the need for further research into safe and effective agent design. 

We emphasize that CyberGym is not intended to encourage malicious behavior. Instead, it serves as a foundation for robust, reproducible, and transparent research in AI-driven cybersecurity. Continued collaboration between the research community, industry stakeholders, and policy makers is essential to ensure that advances in AI capabilities lead to greater security rather than increased risk.

## A THE USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS 

Large Language Models (LLMs) were primarily used to support writing, revision, and other textfocused tasks, such as improving clarity, refining grammar and style, and assisting with the organization of written content. In addition, LLMs were utilized to aid in the process of data construction, as described in detail in Section 3.3. All text and data generated or revised with LLM assistance were carefully reviewed and validated by the authors to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and compliance with academic standards. 

## B DETAILS OF CYBERGYM BENCHMARK 

We now provide more details of our benchmark, including general statistics in Table 3, crash types in Table 4, and included projects in Table 5. A discussion of these details can be found in Section 3.

## C DETAILS ON EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

**Prompts Used in Benchmark Construction** We use GPT-4.1 to filter and rephrase commit messages. Figure 9 presents the prompt used to exclude commit messages that either lack informative descriptions of the vulnerability or address multiple issues. We include a comprehensive list of example commit messages and our preferred answers to help the LLM make more accurate decisions. Figure 10 shows the prompt used to rephrase patch commit messages into vulnerability descriptions.

I will provide you the message of a commit that fixes a security vulnerability. Your task is to rephrase the commit message as a description of the vulnerability. Include the information in the commit message, keep the same meaning and the original tone as much as possible. 

Include the necessary function names, file names mentioned in the commit message. Do not include information about oss-fuzz or any other cross references such as issue number and bug number. Do not describe how the vulnerability can be addressed. Do not add your own speculations and ideas. No need to extend the explanation. Only output the rephrased description and do not output anything else. Use present tense and do not use past tense. The input will be in the following format: MESSAGE: the commit message 

Figure 10: Prompt for rephrasing commit messages. 

**Human Verification of LLM-Based Filtering and Rephrasing** We conduct expert audits to evaluate the quality of LLM-based filtering and rephrasing. The audit includes 300 stratified samples (150 retained by the pipeline and 150 filtered out) covering 96 projects and all crash types. The distribution of PoC lengths, which serves as a proxy for task difficulty, is similar between this audited subset and the full dataset, as illustrated in Figure 11. Two authors collaboratively define the evaluation criteria, independently review the samples, and adjudicate disagreements. Interannotator agreement is strong, with Cohen’s _κ_ of 0.82 ± 0.03 prior to adjudication. For filtering, experts examine whether each vulnerability description include sufficient detail for reproducing the corresponding vulnerability; 6 cases (4% of all selected samples) lack the necessary locating information, corresponding to an estimated precision of 96%. We also identify 10 false negatives, indicating that only a small fraction of valid samples are excluded. For rephrasing, experts evaluate whether the rewritten descriptions preserved all essential technical content while removing patchspecific details (e.g., patching instructions, commit hashes, and issue IDs); all reviewed instances meet these criteria. These results reflect the stability of our pipeline.

Figure 11: Distribution of PoC lengths for the audited subset versus the full dataset. 

**Agent Instructions** We provide the user prompt to agents as shown in Figure 12. We provide all necessary information and inputs under the agent workspace directory “/workspace”. The agent is free to check these contents using its built-in tools or command line. For CTF agents, if the submitted PoC triggers a crash, a flag is also returned to accommodate their evaluation process. This simulates typical CTF scenarios, which is required in the workflow designed in the CTF agent frameworks. Figure 13 presents the template used to construct the detailed README.md file for each task. Different difficulty levels specify different files in the Files section: Level 0 includes only repo-vul.tar.gz; Level 1 adds description.txt; Level 2 adds error.txt; Level 3 further adds patch.diff and repo-fix.tar.gz. 

**Compute Resources** We use a machine equipped with 2x AMD EPYC 9654 96-Core Processors and 1.5T RAM to host the submission environment. The submission server uses about 10TB of disk to store all tasks’ environments. We run the agents on the same machine and call LLM APIs to do model inference. These APIs are either provided by the model vendors or hosted by ourselves.

**Detailed Agent Settings** Cybench is configured with a maximum output of 2,000 tokens, a maximum input of 6,000 tokens, as described in their paper, and a maximum of 100 iterations. For EnIGMA, we use the ctf_pwn.yaml configuration file with demonstrations removed and a cost budget of $2.0. OpenHands is configured with a maximum output of 2,048 tokens with a maximum of 100 iterations. Codex is also configured with a maximum of 100 iterations. These configurations are designed to result in a comparable cost budget of approximately $2.0. Apart from these configurations, we use the default settings specified in the repository of each agent. 

By default, we disable the thinking mode for Qwen3-235B-A22B and Claude-3.7-Sonnet. For o4mini, we enable medium reasoning effort. In the thinking mode of Qwen3-235B-A22B, we increase the maximum output tokens to 4,096. Similarly, for the extended thinking mode of Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Claude-Sonnet-4, we set a thinking budget of 2,048 tokens and increase the maximum output tokens to 4,096. We disable the tool use when comparing w/ and w/o thinking mode for Claude-3.7Sonnet and Claude-Sonnet-4. Tool use is disabled when comparing with and without thinking mode for Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Claude-Sonnet-4, since the models perform extended thinking only in response to user messages, not when processing tool outputs Anthropic (a). 

**Model and Agent Versions** Table 6 presents the detailed model checkpoints used in the experiment. Table 7 shows the detailed commit versions of the agents we use in our experiments. 

**New Vulnerabilities Discovery Settings** To support new vulnerability discovery, we leverage the infrastructure in the OSS-Fuzz repository to build the latest versions (at the time of writing) of the following projects using libFuzzer and AddressSanitizer. We use the level 0 setting in our benchmark framework and let the agent generate PoCs to trigger new vulnerabilities in these projects, similar to a fuzzing setting.

## D ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

**More Details of Data Contamination Analysis** Figure 14 shows the distributions of PoC lengths across the pre- and post-cutoff splits for GPT-4.1/o4-mini, GPT-5, and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, all of which have sufficiently large post-cutoff samples (i.e., greater than 50 samples). The distributions are highly similar, suggesting that PoC length which roughly indicates the difficulty is not confounded with the knowledge-cutoff split.

**Success Rates Based on Software Projects and Crash Types** We recalculated success rates using balanced resampling by crash type and target project. For each resampling strategy, we first computed the average success rate within each project (or crash type), then averaged across all projects (or crash types). Across all analyses, balanced resampling produced no significant changes to our conclusions. Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare success rates of diffent models and agent frameworks, respectively, under project-based and crash-type-based resampling. Furthermore, to provide more detailed analysis beyond a single success rate, we break down success rates by crash types for OpenHands with Claude-Sonnet-4 (for the top 10 crash types). The results show that success rates are relatively consistent across different crash types, ranging from 10% to 25%, compared to the overall success rate of 18%.

**Command Usage Reflects Common and Distinct Agent Behaviors** Figure 17 presents the top 10 commands executed by the considered agent frameworks using GPT-4.1 under level 1 difficulty. The majority of these commands are associated with file searching and browsing. The agent EnIGMA primarily invokes a variety of helper scripts defined within its framework, while the other agents mainly depend on standard bash commands. Among the general-purpose agents, OpenHands and Codex (shown in Figure 17a and Figure 17b, respectively), the ls command is the most frequently used, appearing in over 25% of all executed commands. This indicates a preference for general file inspection. Notably, OpenHands often chains multiple commands together using basic Bash scripting constructs such as for loops and &&, which leads to a higher average command count compared to other agents. Moreover, OpenHands includes a dedicated think tool that prompts the model to explicitly reason about its progress and plan subsequent steps. In contrast, the CTF-focused agents, EnIGMA and Cybench (see Figure 17c and Figure 17d), demonstrate more task-specific command usage. For instance, EnIGMA often executes commands such as edit and open to manipulate specific files, whereas Cybench frequently uses grep and cat to search within files and

display their contents. Additionally, the high frequency of python3 usage among the CTF agents suggests a greater reliance on advanced scripting for problem-solving. 

These observations offer several insights for future tool development. Instead of repeatedly invoking ls to explore directory contents, agents could benefit from having the file structure provided directly in their execution context. This would reduce redundant operations and improve efficiency. Furthermore, designing and exposing reusable helper scripts for common tasks, such as file inspection, pattern searching, or automated editing, can streamline agent behavior and encourage more structured interactions. Incorporating such enhancements may lead to more capable and context-aware agents. 

**Quantitative Failure Mode Analysis** We present additional quantitative analysis of failure modes and agent behaviors across difficulty levels. Beyond the issues discussed in the main text (e.g., unsuccessful attempts with different PoCs, repeated confirmation requests, and overly long command outputs that exhaust the context window), we identify several further recurrent patterns. First, agents often terminate without achieving success, either by giving up prematurely or incorrectly declaring success, as shown in Table 9, occurring in roughly 30% of cases. We provide an example in Figure 19, where the agent fails to generate a successful PoC and stops early. Second, agents sometimes generate excessively long PoCs directly in plaintext (e.g., printing 1000 ‘A’ characters verbatim instead of using a compact expression such as "A"*1000). We provide an example of a tool-parsing error in Figure 20. These outputs often exceed token limits and trigger downstream tool-parsing errors, accounting for approximately 20% of cases. Third, when provided with richer location signals at higher difficulty levels (e.g., stack traces or patch diffs), agents frequently spend many steps repeatedly invoking simple retrieval utilities such as grep, ls, and find. We provide an example at level 2 in Figure 21, where the agent uses a large number of grep and ls calls to search for files. These attempts often fail to retrieve meaningful information, consuming substantial interaction budget that could have been used for more substantive reasoning. Higher difficulty levels show slightly increased failure rates in Table 9 despite offering more information. 

These observations suggest several directions for improving agent performance: (1) integrating better semantic search and domain-specific tools to enable more efficient retrieval; (2) encouraging greater use of scripting and more robust error handling to avoid getting stuck on repeated low-level operations; (3) incorporating mechanisms for more critical self-evaluation so that agents continue to iterate meaningfully rather than giving up prematurely or declaring success incorrectly; (4) foundationally improving the reasoning capabilities of the backbone models.

**Marginal Improvement with Higher Step Counts** Figure 18 illustrates the distribution of results of OpenHands with Claude-Sonnet-4 across different number of agent execution steps, with the maximum number of steps constrained to 100. Successful outcomes are primarily concentrated between steps 20 and 80, with a noticeable peak between steps 20 and 50. However, nearly half of runs terminate near the upper limit of 80-100 steps without achieving a successful outcome, as indicated by the grey “Fail” bars. This distribution suggests that while agents can solve relatively simple instances early on, they frequently encounter difficulties with more complex cases, often trying different test cases and performing code analysis in later iteration steps without success. These results indicate that our 100-step limit offers an effective balance, allowing most solvable problems to be completed while efficiently capping resource use on intractable cases.

## E ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE PATCHES AND ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES 

**An Example of an Incomplete Patch Identified by** **<mark>the A</mark> gents** This vulnerability occurs in GDAL (OSGeo), an open-source translator library for raster <mark>and ve</mark> ctor geospatial data formats. The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference when processi <mark>ng cor</mark> rupted JPEG streams through the external libjpeg library (Lane & Independen <mark>t JPEG</mark> Group). The root cause is that GDAL fails to provide all required error handling functions through function pointers, leading to a null pointer being invoked later in execution. The maintainers addressed this issue across three separate commits ( 0974bb, 20f840, 7f5252 ~~<mark>). W</mark>~~ hen we tested the agents based on the first commit alone, they successfully generated a PoC that triggered the vulnerability at the same location within GDAL, demonstrating the patch’s incompleteness. 

**Analysis of the Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Uncovered by the Agents** Following responsible disclosure practices, we reported the crashes, corresponding PoCs, and basic analyses to the developers. Below is a brief summary of the common patterns observed: The crashes stem from several recurring issues, including insufficient error handling, missing boundary checks, and excessive recursion or deep nesting. These problems result in vulnerabilities including 6 out-of-bounds reads and 1 out-of-bounds writes, 13 null pointer dereferences, 2 wild-address read, 1 double free, and 11 stack overflows. 

## F ADDITIONAL CASE STUDIES 

Figure 22 illustrates an example of OpenHands + GPT-4.1, in which the agent copies an existing GIF test case from the original repository (Step 40), mutates it by writing Python scripts (Steps 42 to 51), and ultimately succeeds in triggering the target vulnerability. In another example presented in Figure 23, the agent (OpenHands + GPT-4.1) compiles the project using build instructions and common build utilities such as configure and Makefile (Steps 29 to 32). It also constructs HDF5 format files using the h5py Python package (Steps 55 to 57). However, the agent ultimately fails to trigger the target vulnerability in this instance. In Figure 24,illustrates a run with OpenHands + Claude-Sonnet-4. Here, the agent repeatedly generates different PoCs but is ultimately unable to complete the target task. In Figure 25, the agent (EnIGMA + GPT-4.1) first attempts to compile a local binary and then begins generating PoCs. Unfortunately, it also fails to achieve the target goal in the end. 

For the task shown in Figure 22, GPT-4.1 successfully mutates existing test cases in the repository using a Python script, carefully adjusting the start-of-scan field in the JPEG file to trigger the target vulnerability. In contrast, Claude-Sonnet-4 fails to produce a PoC capable of triggering the vulnerability, as shown in Figure 24. Claude-3.7-Sonnet fails due to creating a file with incorrect arguments. SWE-Gym-32B encounters errors when attempting to read a file using the wrong path. OpenHands-32B, R2E-Gym-32B, and Qwen3-235B-A22B all repeatedly attempt to generate malformed test cases through Python scripts but fail, suggesting they lack proper understanding and reasoning of the conditions required to trigger the vulnerability.

Overall, the agents showcase promising abilities in performing vulnerability analysis, showcasing an ability to inspect files, reason through multi-step tasks, and use scripting techniques effectively. However, to generate more sophisticated PoCs, they require more advanced tools and the ability to conduct deeper code analysis. Enhancing their reasoning and code comprehension abilities while building better frameworks will be critical to scaling their effectiveness in complex security tasks.
