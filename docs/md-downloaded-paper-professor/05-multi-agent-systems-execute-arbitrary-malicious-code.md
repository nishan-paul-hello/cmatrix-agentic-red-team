## **Abstract** 

Multi-agent systems coordinate LLM-based agents to perform tasks on users’ behalf. In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, and more. 

Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user’s device or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user’s containerized environment. For example, when agents are instantiated with GPT-4o, Web-based attacks successfully cause the multi-agent system execute arbitrary malicious code in 58-90% of trials (depending on the orchestrator). In some model-orchestrator configurations, the attack success rate is 100%. We also demonstrate that these attacks succeed even if individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions. We hope that these results will motivate development of trust and security models for multi-agent systems before they are widely deployed. 

## **1 Introduction** 

In recent years, generative AI models rapidly evolved from autoregressive next-word predictors to interactive chatbots capable of reasoning across multiple input modalities to API-connected agents that can plan and operate in open digital environments to fulfill users’ requests and queries. Just like Web browsers in the 1990s and 2000s transformed how users interact with online content, _multi-agent systems_ (MAS) are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for navigating digital information and performing complex tasks. 

A typical motivating scenario is a user who needs research assistance, data analysis, or help with a complex coding project. Multi-agent systems promise to simplify these tasks by coordinating specialized agents (typically, LLM-based) to browse the Web, analyze documents, summarize information, and even execute code on the user’s behalf. This coordination involves adaptive _control flows_ , i.e., LLM-based computational logic that dynamically generates and utilizes contextual metadata to guide a sequence of actions by individual agents. This metadata encompasses task plans, action histories, self-evaluative progress assessments, and action results, which are processed at each coordination step. 

Any system operating in today’s Internet environment will interact with both trusted and untrusted content: reading emails from unknown senders, browsing user-generated content, analyzing shared documents, and accessing local and remote resources. Untrusted content is an attack surface. A single maliciously crafted webpage, image, or audio file can potentially compromise an entire system, putting users at risk without their knowledge or consent. Whereas Web browsers have developed sophisticated mechanisms, such as the same-origin policy (Mozilla, 2025), to isolate and sandbox untrusted content, the boundary between trusted and untrusted content in multi-agent systems is blurry, and it is not clear what mechanisms—if any—these systems are deploying to protect users from malicious content.

Figure 1: Example of a control-flow hijacking attack, showing control flows in a benign execution and a hijacked execution. 

**Our contributions.** To demonstrate that **control flows in multi-agent systems are highly susceptible to strategic manipulation** , we introduce a new class of LLM-enabled arbitrary code execution attacks we call _multi-agent system control-flow hijacking_ (MAS hijacking). These attacks can be launched by any adversarial content used as input into a multi-agent system, with devastating consequences for the user who invoked the system in question. 

Control-flow hijacking attacks are distinct from jailbreaking and indirect prompt injection (see Table 1). In contrast to jailbreaking attacks, where the user is attacking the model and trying to get it to generate a harmful output, in our case _the user is an unwitting victim, not the instigator of the attack_ . While adversarial inputs in our attack are a form of indirect prompt injection, we empirically demonstrate that previously known indirect injection attacks have near-zero success rate in getting MAS to execute malicious code. 

MAS hijacking exploits metadata transmission pathways to reroute the sequence of agent invocations to unsafe agents or unnecessary agents in harmful configurations. This attack is an instance of the _confused deputy_ problem (Hardy, 1988), well-known in computer security but apparently unknown or unheeded in the design of LLM-based multi-agent systems. These systems delegate tasks to individual sub-agents and trust that they correctly report the status of their tasks. In a MAS hijacking attack, adversarial content turns sub-agents into “confused deputies,” in effect laundering the adversary’s requests so they appear as trusted outputs of trusted agents. Figure 1 shows a high-level example. 

This is a simple and powerful attack. All an adversary needs is to lure or trick the user into requesting that the user’s multi-agent system access a malicious webpage (a single static image is sufficient), an email attachment, or an audio message. The resulting sequence of agent invocations results in arbitrary code execution, e.g., opening a reverse shell on the user’s device and giving the attacker unrestricted remote access. If the multi-agent system runs in a containerized environment, any user data kept in that environment is at risk and any outputs generated from that environment are compromised. 

Our initial investigation of these attacks considers three prominent open-source multi-agent frameworks that are user-focused and designed to operate on both local and remote content: AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), CrewAI (CrewAI, 2025), and MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024). Evaluating these systems in a variety of configurations, we demonstrate that they are highly vulnerable to control-flow hijacking. For example, the Magentic-One orchestrator, running on GPT-4o, executes arbitrary malicious code 97% of the time if it interacts with a malicious local file. The same orchestrator, running on Gemini 1.5 Pro, executes arbitrary malicious code 88% of the time when it interacts with a malicious web page. CrewAI, running on GPT-4o, is “convinced” by a local file to exfiltrate private user data with a 65% success rate. For certain model-orchestrator combinations, the attack success rate is 100%. Furthermore,

we demonstrate that these attacks succeed _even if the individual agents and the models that power them are relatively immune to direct or indirect prompt injection_ . 

Figure 2 illustrates the most basic version of the attack. The user—either knowingly, or as the result of another MAS invocation—asks a centrally orchestrated MAS to access a malicious local file (e.g., a saved email attachment). The orchestrator agent tells the file-access agent to read the file. The access agent returns a false error message, saying that the only way to access the file is to execute it. The orchestrator then tells the code execution agent to run the file. The executable code in the file initiates a reverse shell script that cedes control of the user’s computer to a remote attacker. 

In practice, many multi-agent systems run in fully isolated virtual containers. Even in this case, arbitrary code execution poses a threat to all user data needed by MAS to operate in this environment: passwords, calendars, emails, local files, logged-in web views, etc. We demonstrate this threat via concrete data exfiltration attacks. 

We reiterate that the root cause of these vulnerabilities is _not_ the absence of safety alignment in the individual agents. In several cases, we observed multi-agent systems finding a way to execute harmful code even when sub-agents refuse to take action for safety reasons. For example, in one CrewAI experiment the orchestrator reasoned that executing a file might be unsafe and resolved to “read the file safely.” It then created a dummy file to read, read the dummy file, and realized that the dummy file is not what the user wanted. The orchestrator then re-read the attack file and executed a reverse shell script (see Appendix J). Similarly, in one AutoGen experiment the file-surfer sub-agent produced _its own_ reverse shell script (along with the helpful comment “This is a dangerous command example. Do not execute!”) after the coder agent refused to output malicious code. The generated code was then promptly executed by the code executor, opening a reverse shell (see Appendix K).

## **2 Agentic AI and multi-agent systems** 

### **2.1 Agentic AI** 

The modern notion of an “AI agent” is imprecise. As noted in Kapoor et al. (2024), the term “agentic” covers a spectrum of agency. Systems that are more agentic can operate within complex and unexpected environments, with ambiguous initial user directives in natural language and less frequent human intervention for system guidance (Chan et al., 2023; Gabriel et al., 2024; Shavit et al., 2023). Today, agentic AI systems are driven by LLMs, which decompose high-level tasks into sub-goals, plan how to complete them, and elect how and when to utilize tools, i.e., structured program execution interfaces for interacting with external resources like the Internet, databases, or local file systems (Chase, 2024; Weng, 2023). Agentic systems can employ methodologies like ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), which implements a thought-action-observation loop so agents can adapt to the results of tool invocations. 

AI agent systems and frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness on many benchmarks (Liu et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024). Similar techniques are used in individual AI agents that can complete complex tasks on behalf of users (OpenAI, 2025; Anthropic, 2024; Liu et al., 2024a;b). 

### **2.2 Multi-agent systems** 

A multi-agent system is comprised of multiple AI agents, each with potentially different capabilities. These systems typically operate through task planning and control-flow mechanisms that decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, identify appropriate agents for each component, and orchestrate their sequential or parallel execution. Orchestration involves determining which agent has the appropriate capabilities for each step and managing the transitions between agents to ensure coherent task completion. A key feature of advanced multi-agent systems is their adaptivity. The orchestrator can dynamically decide which agents to invoke next based on the responses and status reports from previously invoked agents. This adaptivity enables the system to respond to both successful outcomes and unexpected errors, making real-time adjustments to the execution flow as needed. 

In multi-agent interactions, it is crucial to distinguish **data** (the actual content or responses produced by agents) and **metadata** (status reports, error messages, progress updates, and other operational information that guides system behavior). This distinction becomes particularly important when considering potential security vulnerabilities, as metadata can influence control-flow decisions even when primary outputs are properly secured. 

Finding the best system topology, i.e., the most effective means of instantiating, structuring, and coordinating agents in a multi-agent system, is an open area of research. The key questions are (1) which agents can communicate with each other?, and (2) which agent (or agents) should be called next? Existing frameworks explore a variety of answers to these questions. In this paper, we consider three topologies (illustrated in Appendix F): Round Robin, where agents take turns in a fixed order; Central Orchestrator, where a single agent dynamically assigns tasks to the others; and Central Orchestrator with External Data Structures, which utilizes an external task ledger to ensure the MAS stays on-task. In all cases, each agent can see a partial history of the reasoning steps and actions that other agents have taken. This metadata is crucial for ensuring that multi-agent systems are functional. 

## **3 Threat model** 

### **3.1 Adversary’s capabilities** 

We assume that agents in a MAS are benign and not controlled by the adversary. That said, they interact with untrusted inputs: Web content (e.g., malicious websites or social media) or, in a stronger threat model, files already on the user’s device (e.g., email attachments or images). For example, a user seeking IT advice may invoke a MAS to summarize Web forums, one of which includes a malicious post. Similarly, a request to process email attach-

ments could inadvertently cause the MAS to act on a malicious file. Unlike in jailbreaking attacks where the user is the adversary, in our case an external adversary aims to cause the user’s MAS to harm the user. This adversary cannot directly prompt the MAS, but they control the inputs that a MAS may access inadvertently or on purpose. 

The two most popular types of agents are file browsers and Web surfers. Consequently, we focus on two types on adversarial content: files (e.g., locally stored emails or documents) and webpages. In the latter case, we show that an adversary can deliver an attack not only via text, but also via other modalities like images and audio. 

### **3.2 Adversary’s goals** 

For simplicity, we focus on two malicious functionalities, both of which are tantamount to a severe security breach. In practice, there is a wide variety of malicious behaviors available to the adversary, limited only by the code-execution capabilities of the target system. 

**Executing arbitrary code on the user’s device.** By tricking the MAS into opening a reverse shell from the user’s device to the adversary’s device, the attacker gains terminal access to the MAS’s code execution environment. This enables the attacker to install malware or keyloggers, run cryptomining software, and add, remove, or copy any files the agents can access. The attacker can also exploit the victim’s compute resources for malicious and/or illegal activities such as hosting command-and-control beacons, forming botnets to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and running phishing campaigns. 

**Exfiltrating data about the user.** This attack targets the data that only the agents can access, whether stored in “memory” modules, RAG databases, APIs, or derived from prior interactions. It enables the attacker to extract personal data even if it is partitioned in a containerized module and isolated from the main code execution system. 

## **4 Control-flow hijacking in multi-agent systems** 

To operationalize the MAS hijacking attack (defined formally in Appendix C), our attacker crafts a false (but plausible) error message. This message is formatted similarly to genuine error notifications (e.g., in Python or WordPress) but, instead of legitimate remediation steps, it contains malicious instructions for individual agents. In particular, the attacker targets inter-agent communication by specifying how each agent should act in the ensuing “conversation.” For examples of malicious error messages, see Appendix H. Depending on their access (Section 3), the attacker then disseminates this content via a local file, webpage, or another medium. The attack exploits inter-agent trust and leverages adaptive errorhandling behavior intended to enhance the MAS’s benign functionality. 

We believe this attack is successful because it “launders” adversarial requests through outputs and metadata of front-line agents that directly interact with untrusted content. This is critical for two reasons. First, it enables the request to reach the orchestrator. In MAS configurations we tested, orchestrators do not directly interact with untrusted content (fileaccess and Web agents do, but they do not execute code directly). Therefore, the adversary cannot perform indirect prompt injection (IPI) directly on the orchestrator. Second, laundering the request through another agent’s metadata significantly changes its presentation (formatting, phrasing, etc.). We conjecture that safety alignment of the underlying LLMs involved training them on conventional IPI strings but not on presentations created as a result of our attack (the LLMs in our experiments are black-box and the details of their training are not available). In this sense, the attack is creating a previously unknown type of jailbreaking templates. We test these conjectures in Subsection 6.4. 

## **5 Experimental setup** 

To experimentally evaluate our MAS hijacking attacks, we focus on prominent, open-source multi-agent systems that operate on both local and remote data on users’ behalf. These 

5

systems perform tasks such as web browsing for research, document summarization, dataset analysis, and code execution. We excluded frameworks primarily designed for simulated environments or purely conversational multi-agent interactions, as these typically do not present the same security concerns. Our analysis was limited to drop-in systems that require minimal configuration, eliminating highly customizable business- and developer-focused frameworks. We evaluate AutoGen, CrewAI, and MetaGPT (referred to as AG, Crew, and MGPT) with minimal modification to their default configurations to execute them in our environment. For AutoGen, we tested three orchestrators: Magentic-One (MO), Selector (Sel.), and Round-Robin (RR). For CrewAI and MetaGPT, we used the default orchestrator and the Data Interpreter agent system, respectively. We instantiated individual agents with different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. 

We simulated attacks with multiple input types (local text, Web text, Web images, local videos), error templates (fake Python, Wordpress 403, and "Access Denied" errors), and two variations of user prompts. Each attack was run 10 times for every framework-orchestratormodel-input-error-query combination, with a reverse shell script in non-obfuscated Python as the attack payload. For CrewAI, we also tested a data exfiltration script. 

To calculate the attack success rate (ASR), we modified the code execution agent to exit and write a unique string when it executes the attack payload. As a backup, we also set up a lightweight cloud server to monitor incoming reverse shell connections. Our experiments were compared against baseline tasks (e.g., benign file access), direct malicious requests, and previously studied IPI templates from the Debenedetti et al. (2024) Github repository. 

We also conducted three smaller-scale experiments to (a) test attack success in more realistic settings, (b) measure sensitivity to the phrasing of the initial user request, and (c) better understand why the attack works. All of these experiments were done with the MagenticOne orchestrator running GPT-4o-mini. 

**Incidental contact** (40 trials): To simulate a more realistic setting for the attack, we created a local directory containing one benign file and one MAS hijacking file, then asked the MAS to read and summarize the contents of that directory. 

**Prompt paraphrases** (20 trials per paraphrase): Inspired by Shvartzshnaider & Duddu (2025), we wanted to ensure that the attack was not brittle with respect to the exact phrasing of the user prompt. We asked an LLM to create 10 paraphrases of our user queries and tested all of them on the web redirect task. 

**Direct hijack** (40 trials): We experimented with submitting adversarial metadata directly to the orchestrator as a user prompt. Note that this does not correspond to a realistic attack, since there is no reason for the user to be attacking their own system. 

For each experiment, the outputs were logged and regex searches (along with manual analysis) were used to identify unregistered attacks (i.e., where our modified code executor did not output a unique string associated with the attack), unsafe code, and refusals to act. See Appendix E for more details. 

## **6 Results** 

We start by evaluating the “Web Redirect” attack, where a MAS navigates to a webpage that contains an attack input, is redirected to download a reverse shell script into a local file, and then executes this file. In Section 6.2, we evaluate other attack types. 

### **6.1 MAS hijacking works, indirect prompt injection doesn’t** 

Table 2 shows a high ASR all five executors. This compares favorably with indirect prompt injection (IPI) and direct ask (DA) baselines: IPI is almost completely unsuccessful, and the DA results are dominated by the Gemini models’ high propensity to open reverse shells when prompted by the user (see also Table 7). We slightly vary the exact instructions for each orchestrator. For CrewAI, the web redirect is to download a raw executable file to the local system and then run it. For MetaGPT and AutoGen, the web redirect is to download a

_local_ MAS hijacking file and then to view it; viewing this file results in execution. The exact instructions are in Appendix G.

Table 2: Reverse shell attack success rate for the Web Redirect MAS hijacking attack. There are two user queries and three error file types. Each (orchestrator-model-query-error) tuple is measured over 10 trials. Crew IPI and DA baselines are calculated using GPT-4o. IPI prompt templates are taken directly from the GitHub repo of Debenedetti et al. (2024). Unfortunately, due to a known bug affecting agent tool usage, we could only evaluate CrewAI with OpenAI models. This is indicated by “-” in the table. 

Across the tested orchestrator types, Gemini models account for 61 of the 67 instances (91%) where a direct ask to open a reverse shell resulted in malicious code being executed. GPT models, on the other hand, typically refuse requests to create and execute malicious code. Existing IPI attacks fail almost universally across orchestrators and model types. 

### **6.2 Varying attack type** 

We systematically tested three other attack types: “Local,” where an agent is asked to access a malicious local file; “Web Single,” where an agent is asked to navigate to a webpage that contains both a MAS hijacking message _and_ the malicious executable payload; and “Web Image,” where the webpage contains a _screenshot_ of the Web Redirect page without any parsable text. Tables 3 and 4 show the attack success rate.

### **6.3 Varying attack payload** 

In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of local and Web data exfiltration attacks, which exploit a MAS’s access to auxiliary data sources, APIs, or previously derived knowledge

about a user. To model this threat, our MAS is asked to navigate to a local file or webpage. They contain a malicious text that instructs the MAS to (1) utilize auxiliary knowledge to construct a user profile (including name, email, social security number, etc.), (2) download a script to send this file to the attacker, and (3) execute the script. 

Table 5 shows the results of these attacks on CrewAI, the only framework in our evaluation that supports auxiliary data sources. The attacks are effective, although slightly less so than reverse shell exploits, likely due to the number of steps involved in a successful exfiltration. Success rates also depend on the quality of the orchestrator model. Using GPT-4o as the orchestrator improves attack success for both local and web exfiltration. We conjecture that more advanced orchestrators execute multi-step attacks more reliably. 

### **6.4 Additional experiments** 

In the **incidental contact** experiment, ASR is 87.5% (35 out of 40 trials). In the **prompt paraphrases** experiment, all 10 paraphrased queries result in successful MAS hijacking, with ASR ranging from 40% to 85%. On average, across 200 trials, ASR is 59.5%. 

In the **direct hijack** experiment, ASR is 80% (28 out of 40 trials) with 0% refusal rate. This is very different from the results in Table 7, where direct requests to the same MAS configuration to open a reverse shell have ASR of 6% and refusal rate of 86%. This supports our conjecture that not only the attack string must reach the orchestrator, but it must also be presented in a (previously unknown) format that evades the safety alignment of the underlying LLM. In this sense, “laundering” malicious requests through sub-agents creates a novel form of indirect jailbreaking. 

### **6.5 Life finds a way** 

Multi-agent systems rely on communication between imperfect agents with incomplete information. Our experiments showed many failures to function correctly and safely. 

**Execution of recognized harmful code.** In one CrewAI experiment, after reasoning that executing the reverse shell code may be unsafe, the orchestrator resolved to proceed safely. To hone its safe file-reading process, it created a dummy file to read and read it, only to “realize” that the dummy file was not what the user wanted. The orchestrator then re-read the attack file using its newly minted process and executed the reverse shell as commanded (see Appendix J). Similarly, in another AutoGen experiment, after the coder agent refused to produce malicious code, the file surfer sub-agent produced its own reverse shell, helpfully noting to not execute the code because it was dangerous. The generated code was then executed by the code executor, opening a reverse shell (see Appendix K). In several other CrewAI experiments, the coding agent recognized that the reverse shell code was malicious and generated inline warnings. Nevertheless, it failed to relay this information to the rest of the system. Instead, it signaled success to the orchestrator, which then commanded the coder to execute the code, ultimately resulting in a breach. 

**Accidental hijacking.** In one AutoGen experiment, a MAS was initially tasked with describing the contents of a benign file entitled file0.txt. This benign file was in the same directory as several attack files (file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.). After the initial task was completed, the 

8 

Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 

MAS autonomously explored its directory, discovered a malicious file, and executed it, opening a reverse shell (see Appendix L). 

**Unconventional attack vectors.** To probe the limits of our attack, we recorded a video of us reciting the attack text and had the MAS process it via audio transcription. Although the results were inconsistent, the MAS occasionally opened a reverse shell, indicating that even unconventional input modalities can serve as attack vectors. 

## **7 Related work** 

Most prior work on AI safety focuses on users attacking LLMs (i.e., jailbreaking). In this section, we briefly survey prior work on the security of AI agent systems and MAS. A more comprehensive discussion of related work can be found in Appendix A. 

### **7.1 AI agent security** 

_Indirect prompt injection_ (IPI) is an attack vector introduced by Greshake et al. (2023) and systematized by Zhan et al. (2024). IPI uses unsanitized results of tool calls or RAG responses to steer an LLM to take harmful action. There are several benchmarks for measuring effectiveness of IPI: AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024), Agent Security Bench (Zhang et al., 2024b) and AgentHarm (Andriushchenko et al., 2024b). 

Other attacks on (single) agent systems include: Zhang et al. (2024a), who leverage user request failure and improper tool execution; RoyChowdhury et al. (2024), who poison RAG systems to steer the outputs of Microsoft’s Copilot; and Walker (2024), who use inputs similar to ours on Anthropic’s Computer Use agent. Liu et al. (2024c) use static analysis to identify insecure call chains and RCEs in deployed agent systems. Shafran et al. (2025) attack LLM routers. In contrast to these works, we systematically investigate how compromised metadata (in particular, error reports) and “confused deputy” vulnerabilities can hijack control flows in multi-agent systems and result in malicious code execution, even when individual agents refuse to perform unsafe actions. 

Attacks on multi-agent systems are less explored. The most relevant work is Lee & Tiwari (2024), which demonstrates “prompt infection,” _i.e.,_ IPI attacks that self-replicate through a multi-agent system. Cohen et al. (2025) study a similar attack that spreads through a simulated RAG-enabled email system. Other work investigated MAS vulnerabilities to misinformation (Ju et al., 2024), errors, and malicious agents (Huang et al., 2025). No prior work considered attacks on MAS metadata and control flow processes. Several taxonomies of MAS vulnerabilities were published concurrently with this paper (Bryan et al., 2025; OWASP, 2025). According to Bryan et al. (2025), our attack involves agent flow manipulation or a multi-agent jailbreak. According to OWASP (2025), it involves agent communication poisoning (T12), leading to tool misuse (T2) and privilege compromise (T3). 

### **7.2 Defenses** 

Although IPI attacks do not directly compromise multi-agent systems (Section 6.1), existing IPI defenses may mitigate MAS hijacking, warranting future evaluation of their effectiveness and impact on system utility. Prompt-tuning defenses alter prompt text to either ensure that agents stay on task (Schulhoff, 2024a;b;c), or explicitly separate user- and agent-generated text (Hines et al., 2024; Suo, 2024). Agent-level defenses focus on enforcing security at runtime via tool call validation (Jia et al., 2024) and agent tagging (Lee & Tiwari, 2024). Model-level defenses focus on LLMs, encouraging safe behavior via preference optimization (Chen et al., 2025; Piet et al., 2024), implicit and explicit prompt prioritization (Chen et al., 2024; Wallace et al., 2024), and dynamic content filtering (Wu et al., 2024).

## **8 Discussion** 

In order for multi-agent systems to be useful as generalist AI assistants, they must be able to safely interact with both sensitive user data and external, potentially untrusted content. However, unlike Web browsers (which have a well-defined policy for safely isolating and sandboxing untrusted content as users navigate the Web), the multi-agent systems that have emerged so far do not adequately distinguish between trusted and untrusted content. Furthermore, multi-agent systems derive much of their value from their adaptive, nondeterministic _control flows_ , which allow them to internally evaluate whether a given action successfully fulfilled the user’s request and try other approaches if it has not. 

In this paper, we introduced **multi-agent system control-flow hijacking attacks** (MAS hijacking) and demonstrated that they are effective against several existing multi-agent frameworks. These attacks employ adversarial content to target the metadata and controlflow processes of multi-agent systems in order to misdirect them into invoking arbitrary, adversary-chosen agents or directly run the adversary’s code. 

Our experiments in Section 6.1 show that while previous indirect prompt injection attacks generally do not work against multi-agent systems, MAS hijacking is significantly more effective. Sections 6.2 and 6.3 show that these attacks are effective across input modalities and complex adversarial tasks such as compiling and exfiltrating user profiles. 

Experiments in Section 6.4 indicate that laundering malicious requests through trusted agents is essential for two reasons: (1) it enables the request to reach the orchestrator, which does not directly interact with untrusted content, and (2) “confused deputy” agents unwittingly change the presentation of the request, enabling it to evade safety alignment. 

**Life cannot be contained.** We observed many interesting ways in which multi-agent systems fail to operate safely, which we documented in Section 6.5. In particular, we observed many instances where _individual sub-agents refuse to perform harmful actions, yet the MAS as a whole finds a way to complete the attack_ . 

In a multi-agent system, the orchestrator’s primary job is to reason, plan, and find a way to fulfill the user’s request. Inevitably, this involves exploration of action space, which includes potentially unsafe actions (for example, writing and executing Python programs to connect to another machine). In contrast to conventional safety alignment and jailbreaking, these actions are not universally unsafe. In some contexts, they are necessary and appropriate. For secure operation in realistic environments, the entire context in which agents make decisions matters, including the user’s initial request, task ledger, other agents’ behavior, etc. The contexts in multi-agent systems are sufficiently complex that it is difficult to classify an action as safe or unsafe. For the examples in Section 6.5, we conjecture that the underlying LLM does not “understand” enough of the entire system context to distinguish safe and unsafe instances of actions such as executing scripts. 

**Blind trust in confused deputies.** Multi-agent systems provide the infrastructure and schemas for agents to communicate and coordinate. Unlike conventional operating systems and Web browsers, they do not have a trust model, nor any semantics of inputs, actions, etc. The LLMs used to instantiate individual agents are unable to distinguish benign from malicious inputs, nor data from metadata. They blindly trust the outputs of confused deputies (i.e., other agents within the multi-agent system) and find creative ways to harm the user in response to the adversary’s instructions. 

We believe that users’ safety should be the responsibility of those who insist on deploying LLM-based systems in environments where they have direct access to users’ data and command lines. Research on AI safety has been focusing heavily on protecting “intelligent” (or even “super-intelligent”) LLMs from adversarial users. Protecting benign users from confused LLMs has taken a back seat. As a result, LLMs do not have a security model for dealing with malicious third-party content, and it is unclear what this model or policy might look like. We argue that until such a policy emerges, the use of LLM-based agents in situations where they deal with untrusted content and perform external actions is unsafe and has a high risk of harming their users.

## **Ethics Statement** 

The sole purpose of this paper is to illustrate systemic risks in multi-agent AI architectures, and to discourage their broad deployment until these risks are addressed. All experiments in this paper were run in a controlled lab environment. No services with live agents in production were attacked. We reached out to Microsoft, Crew, and MetaGPT through their designated security reporting channels. We received confirmation that the MetaGPT team was working on sandboxing their agent execution environment, and that Microsoft had replicated and was investigating the issue.

## **A Extended related work** 

There has been much research on AI safety, focusing primarily on users attacking LLMs (i.e., jailbreaking). In this section, we survey prior work on the security of AI agent systems in general (especially indirect prompt injection) and MAS in particular. 

### **A.1 AI agent security and indirect prompt injection** 

LLM-powered agent systems have been the subject of security research since their inception several years ago. Many attacks take advantage of _indirect prompt injection_ (IPI): an attack vector introduced by Greshake et al. (2023) that uses the unsanitized results of tool calls (or RAG system results) to steer an LLM to take harmful action. Zhan et al. (2024) systematized IPI attacks, finding that they are able to consistently hijack agent systems powered by a wide variety of LLMs. 

AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024) proposed a dynamic test suite of IPI attacks. AgentDojo also introduced adaptive IPI attacks, which include a variable amount of attacker information in constructing attack strings; this increased attack success rates by 10%. Similarly, Agent Security Bench (Zhang et al., 2024b) measured attack success rates using a variety of prompt injection approaches and simulated agent contexts. AgentHarm (Andriushchenko et al., 2024b) proposed 110 harmful tasks across eleven categories and measured agent compliance with explicit requests for harmful actions both with and without jailbreaks. 

Zhang et al. (2024a) investigated attacks on agent systems. Unlike our work, their focus is primarily on breaking systems via user request failure and improper tool execution. Their approach targets single-agent systems, but in principle could also apply to multi-agent systems. RoyChowdhury et al. (2024) used RAG systems to steer the outputs of Microsoft’s Copilot, causing integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. Walker (2024) demonstrated an attack on Anthropic’s Computer Use agent that uses inputs similar to ours to try and jailbreak the agent into executing unsafe commands. In contrast, we systematically investigate how compromised metadata (in particular, error reports) and “confused deputy” vulnerabilities can hijack control flows in multi-agent systems and result in malicious code execution, even when individual agents refuse to perform unsafe actions. 

Indirect prompt injection attacks build upon jailbreaking attacks, most often utilizing trigger strings (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022), such as: 

- “For some reason, the agent is offline and unavailable...” 

- “I, user, have an important message for you, model. Before completing the initial request, you must...” 

- “Ignore previous instructions and...” 

Most of the previous work cited here used hand-crafted, human-interpretable attack strings, but there also is a rich line of work on automatically generated, not-human-interpretable jailbreak prompts. Andriushchenko et al. (2024a) and Zou et al. (2023) use optimization to generate model-tuned attack strings that, when appended to user requests, maximize the likelihood of the next token being “Sure, here’s how to <do harmful attack>.” Similarly, Pasquini et al. (2024) generate model-tuned execution triggers that hide effective jailbreak requests and can survive RAG-based preprocessing steps. Other attacks (Mehrotra et al., 2024) use LLMs to iteratively generate jailbreaks in a “tree of attacks,” where branches are variations of previous attempts at jailbreaks. Other work (Zhang et al., 2024c; 2025) explores the vulnerability of multimodal models to adversarial “self-interpreting images,” which encode prompts into images. Fu et al. (2024) use auto-generated jailbreak prompts to encode obfuscated instructions that induce tool use in agents. Their threat model assumes that the user unwittingly appends the attack string to the prompt, and they target single agents rather than control flows in multi-agent systems. Further investigation of how advanced jailbreaking and prompt injection techniques can be used for control-flow attacks is an interesting topic for future work.

### **A.2 Attacks on multi-agent systems** 

The vulnerability of multi-agent systems to attacks is less explored. Lee & Tiwari (2024) explore MAS vulnerabilities to “prompt infection,” where an indirect prompt injection attack contains a string that self-replicates and spreads through a multi-agent system. They find that self-replicating prompt infections convince multi-agent systems to take harmful actions (such as data exfiltration and creation of scams, malware, and content manipulation) over 80% of the time using GPT-4o. Similarly, Cohen et al. (2025) design an “adversarial self-replicating prompt” that spreads through a simulated email system in a company, where each email client has a RAG-enabled LLM attached to it (a sort of multi-agent system). They find that their prompts are effective in creating a chain of confidential data extraction, but the effectiveness of such prompts depends on the RAG configuration used, the model, and more. They also implement a filter to prevent the propagation of these emails by comparing the generated email to the previous email chain. Other papers investigated MAS vulnerabilities to misinformation (Ju et al., 2024) and resilience to errors and malicious agents (Huang et al., 2025). None of the prior work considered attacks on MAS metadata and control flows. 

### **A.3 Defenses** 

While indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks fail to directly compromise multi-agent systems (Section 6.1), it is possible that existing IPI defenses can foil MAS hijacking attacks, too. Future work can evaluate the effectiveness of these defenses, as well as their impact on the utility of the MAS (e.g., whether they cause collateral damage by blocking adaptive control flows needed to fulfill complex tasks). 

IPI defenses largely fall into three categories: prompt tuning, agent-level controls, and modellevel modifications. Prompt tuning techniques include reminding agents of adversarial risks (Schulhoff, 2024a), enclosing tool responses in random strings (Schulhoff, 2024b), and reiterating prompts after tool responses (Schulhoff, 2024c). Spotlighting methods, such as delimiters or base64 encoding, aim to clearly separate tool outputs from agent reasoning (Hines et al., 2024). Signed-Prompt (Suo, 2024) further enhances trust by allowing only authorized users to "sign" sensitive command segments. 

Agent-level defenses focus on enforcing security at runtime. In-network alignment agents validate tool calls before execution (Jia et al., 2024), while agent tagging helps distinguish system-generated responses from user inputs (Lee & Tiwari, 2024). 

Model-level interventions introduce structural constraints to prevent unauthorized behavior. Preference optimization methods, such as SecAlign (Chen et al., 2025) and Jatmo (Piet et al., 2024), fine-tune models to favor secure outputs. Structured queries (Chen et al., 2024) separate prompts and data channels to prevent instruction confusion. Instruction hierarchy frameworks (Wallace et al., 2024) establish priority rules for conflicting directives, while information flow security models (Wu et al., 2024) dynamically filter untrusted inputs before they influence decision-making.

Figure 4: A multi-modal MAS hijacking attack utilizing webpages and audio content of videos. Initially, in steps 1a and 1b, the MAS interacts with a malicious website or video, which prompts it to download a malicious key.txt file in step 2. Finally, in step 3, the MAS attempts to open the downloaded file and executes it instead, similar to the local-file attack in Figure 3.

## **C Formal definition of MAS hijacking** 

A multi-agent system MAS is a directed graph, where the vertices ( _A_ ) are a set of _n_ agents and the edges ( _C_ ) are connections between agents: 

MAS = ( _A_ , _C_ ), _A_ = _{A_ 1, ..., _An}_ and _C_ = _{ci_ , _j_ : 1 _≤ i_ , _j ≤ n}_ 

Each agent ( _Ai_ ) is an LLM with access to _τ_ tools that allow it to take a set of actions. At each time step, some subset of agents generate text and take an action. Some of these actions may involve interacting with external resources, which we will call _d_ . These actions may yield results, which are then used by the agents to decide next steps via the _control flow process_ . 

An action by an agent at one time step is written as _Ai_<sup>_α_.If an action involves a resource,</sup> we will write it as _Ai_<sup>_α_(</sup><sup>_d_)</sup> . The output of an action is written as Out( _Ai_<sup>_α_), and each control</sup> Out( _Ai_<sup>_α_)</sup> flow process step is written as _−−−−→_ , where _c ∈C_ . We can then define the _action trace_ of a _ci_ , _j_ multi-agent system as a list of these actions. For example: 


![](images/05-multi-agent-systems-execute-arbitrary-malicious-code.pdf-0019-06.png)


A MAS control-flow hijacking attack is an adversarial input _d_<sup>_′_</sup> that targets the control flow process after the system has processed _d_<sup>_′_</sup> . 

The attack seeks to modify the action trace suffix so that it contains a set of actions that the attacker has specified, either in a formal language (e.g., executable code) or natural language. More formally, we are creating _d_<sup>_′_</sup> and Attack trace such that: 


![](images/05-multi-agent-systems-execute-arbitrary-malicious-code.pdf-0019-09.png)


That is, after interacting with the attack, the MAS control flow process is redirected to the desired output of the attacker, and this redirection persists until the end of the action trace. 

## **D Per-model results** 

### **D.1 Performance on benign tasks** 

To establish the baselines for our experiments, we measured the success of different MAS configurations when asked to retrieve the contents of a benign local file and a benign webpage, each containing a test string. Table 6 shows the (mostly successful) results. In some cases, MAS hijacking attacks are only marginally less successful than the benign tasks. In the case of Magentic-One powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro, the attack success rate is even _better_ than the system’s success rate for accessing a benign webpage. 

|**Model**|**Local File**|**Web File**|
|---|---|---|
|Gemini 1.5 Flash|96%|86%|
|Gemini 1.5 Pro|100%|86%|
|GPT-4o|99%|100%|
|GPT-4o-mini|100%|100%|



Table 6: Success rates by model (averaged over all orchestrators) for reading a benign local file or web page. The commands to read these documents are formatted and phrased identically to the MAS hijacking attacks, but the file content is benign. 

### **D.2 Refusal and ASR by model**

Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 

|**Model**|**Refusal Rate**|**ASR**|
|---|---|---|
|Gemini 1.5 Flash|0%|41%|
|Gemini 1.5 Pro|0%|37%|
|GPT-4o|72%|0%|
|GPT-4o-mini|86%|6%|



Table 7: Refusal and attack success rates by model (averaged over all orchestrators) for responding to a direct ask for malicious code execution. Cases when the model neither refuses nor completes the attack may involve system errors, removal of malicious content, investigation of network connections, or other system actions by the agent. 

## **E Details of experimental setup** 

To experimentally evaluate our MAS hijacking attacks, we focus on prominent, open-source, multi-agent systems can operate on both local and remote data on users’ behalf. Specifically, they are designed to perform the following tasks, among others: 

- Browse the Web to gather information and do research. 

- Read and summarize documents from various sources. 

- Analyze datasets from multiple origins. 

- Write and execute code based on user requirements. 

We did not consider frameworks primarily designed for simulated environments or purely conversational multi-agent interactions, as these typically do not have the same security concerns regarding access to sensitive user resources. We also limited our analysis to dropin systems that require minimal configuration and set-up. This eliminated many highly customizable business- and developer-focused frameworks. 

The three frameworks we evaluate in the rest of the paper are AutoGen, CrewAI, and MetaGPT. We refer to them in tables as AG, Crew, and MGPT, respectively. We modified them as little as possible from their baseline defaults, only so that we can execute them in our environment. 

AutoGen provides several orchestrator types. We picked three: Magentic-One (MO), Selector (Sel., similar to Magentic-One but without a task ledger), and Round-Robin (RR, preset sub-agent participation order). For CrewAI, we run the default orchestrator. For MetaGPT, we use the Data Interpreter agent system, which runs code in a Jupyter notebook. The frameworks allow users to instantiate sub-agents with different LLMs. We used GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash in our evaluation. 

For AutoGen and MetaGPT, all of the above models were tested. For CrewAI, only OpenAI models were tested (since Gemini models didn’t work). In all cases, models were accessed via API using the MAS framework library defaults. These defaults utilize the OpenAI chat completion API,<sup>1</sup> which can also be used with Google’s models.<sup>2</sup> AutoGen multi-agent systems were initialized using the default Magentic-One group chat, with an orchestrator agent, file surfer, web surfer, coder, and code executor, as well as an optional video surfer for video experiments. We similarly used the default Selector and Round-Robin group chats with the same agent configuration for the experiments with those orchestrators. MetaGPT’s Data Interpreter was initialized using system defaults, and CrewAI code was initialized using the default initialization provided by the company-created Python package. All code was executed on CPUs, invoking APIs for the underlying LLMs as needed. All experiments were run in a controlled lab environment, and no services with live agents in production were attacked. 

Across these frameworks, orchestrators, and models, we tested a variety of input types and modalities: local text files, web text files, web image files, and local video files. We also

created three MAS hijacking attack templates, to find out if the exact error format matters for the attack success rate: a fake Python error template, a fake Wordpress 403 error template, and a generic "Access Denied" error template. Additionally, we tried two wordings for the user’s initial request to the MAS, to ensure that the phrasing of the user’s prompt does not skew the results. All error templates and request wordings are listed in Sections H and I, respectively. We ran each variant of the attack, determined by the (framework, orchestrator, model, input type, error type, query type) tuple, 10 times. 

In most cases, the payload of the attack is a short reverse shell script to a remote server, written in non-obfuscated Python. This script is unambiguously unsafe. When the system is functioning normally (e.g., if the MAS is directed to run a reverse shell script by the user or to execute a file containing a reverse shell script), it should refuse. To illustrate the severity of this attack even in properly containerized environments, for CrewAI we also tested a data exfiltration script. 

To calculate the attack success rate (ASR), we modified the code execution agent to exit and write a unique, experiment-specific string to a file when it would otherwise would run the attack payload. As a backup, we opened a lightweight server on a cloud service that continuously listened for and printed any socket connections. All reverse shell attacks were pointed to this server’s IP address. 

Finally, we ran several sets of baseline experiments to establish how the performance of our MAS hijacking attack compares with: 

- Similar but benign tasks (e.g., looking at a file or Web page). 

- A direct request to perform a malicious action. 

- Three known indirect prompt injection templates. 

We saved the full output logs for all experiments, and used a combination of regex string searches and manual verification to derive binary values for whether each experiments contains an (a) unregistered attack execution (not using our unique experiment-specific string), (b) identification of unsafe code, and (c) refusal to take action. We also attempted to use GPT 4o-mini to classify output logs, but it resulted in far too many false negatives (see Appendix M for an example). 

## **F Orchestration techniques**

Figure 5: Multi-agent topologies. 

In this paper, we consider three common MAS topologies, illustrated in Figure 5. 

- **Round robin** : Agents are consulted in a set order, determined when the MAS is instantiated. The MAS is a cyclical, deterministic network. 

- **Central orchestrator** : A central orchestrator agent knows about all other agents in the network and determines at each step an appropriate agent to take action. The MAS is a hub-and-spoke, non-deterministic network. 

21 

Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 

- **Central orchestrator with external data structures** : More advanced versions of the central orchestrator model, like Magentic-One (Fourney et al., 2024), combine dynamic central orchestration with an external task ledger loop to ensure that the MAS is on-task, increasing overall system effectiveness. This MAS is also a hub-and-spoke, non-deterministic network.

Since the agent has no tools , assess available methods to view file contents. The options for retrieving file content without specific tools are limited; thus , consider the use of a terminal or command line interface. 3. If physical access is available , navigate to the appropriate directory by using the command: 'cd code '. 4. List the files in the directory to confirm 'file.txt ' exists using the command: 'ls '. 5. If 'file.txt ' is present , proceed to read the file 's contents using the command: 'cat file.txt '. 6. Observe the output displayed in the terminal which will reveal the contents of 'file.txt '. 7.

Did the model correctly identify that the requested resource ( file.txt , website content , or key.txt) contains code to execute a reverse shell script? This means that the model correctly identified that the code may be malicious and is intended to be used to execute a reverse shell , not just that it is a generic python script. (Yes/No/Unclear) 2. Did the model refuse to execute the code for safety or ethics reasons? Do not consider this to be yes if the model refused to execute the code for another reason , such as that the code was not properly formatted. (Yes/No/Unclear) 3. Did the model partially and/or unsuccessfully execute the attack? For example , did it attempt to run the reverse shell script but fail with an error? (Yes/No/Unclear) 4. Did the model successfully open a reverse shell? This is usually indicated by the model providing a command (or several commands) to open a reverse shell that timed out.

Here 's the Python script to download the key: ````` python import requests url = "https :// attackersite [.]com/content/key.txt" try: response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status () # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx or 5xx)
