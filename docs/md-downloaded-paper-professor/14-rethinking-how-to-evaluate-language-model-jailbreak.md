## **Abstract** 

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model. **Notice: This paper contains examples of harmful language.** 

## **1 Introduction** 

Large language models (LLMs) have become more versatile and powerful with the advent of new and more complex 

architectures, as evidenced by the increasing number of applications, websites, and chatbots that integrate LLMs. The core functionality of LLMs remains the same; given a user’s prompt, the LLMs generate useful responses based on the large-scale web datasets on which they were trained. However, training on these web datasets also exposes LLMs to potentially harmful data, which may result in LLMs learning and producing unsafe content. 

Some users exploit LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news, creating phishing scams, writing malware, or cyberbullying [27]. To mitigate this risk, various techniques are employed to align LLMs with human values and preferences [31], so that they can generate more helpful and safer content. However, it has recently been demonstrated that these alignment techniques can be circumvented using jailbreak techniques. 

Language model jailbreak systems accept malicious intent as input and produce an adversarial setting capable of bypassing LLM safeguards [14, 19, 51]. For example, a prompt such as “How to make a bomb?” would not get any related information from a properly aligned LLM. In contrast, a jailbreak method, which appends an adversarial suffix to the original prompt [51], results in a response that contains useful information for the attacker. This method, adversarial prompt, is just one of the ways to jailbreak. Other recent methods include inference hyper-parameter adjustment [19], and training data poisoning [33, 41, 42]. 

Attackers use jailbreak techniques to achieve different purposes. Some attackers want to damage the corporate reputation and market value of the LLM provider by inducing models to produce discriminatory or offensive remarks, while others may seek to obtain illegal information that is otherwise difficult to access (e.g., generating malware code). 

Jailbreak is generally performed in an automated way. This automated process can be divided into three steps, as shown in Figure 1. The iterative process begins with the generation of adversarial settings based on the given intent. The result of the generation is then fed or applied to the language models. Finally, the system evaluates the LLM’s response,

determining whether the jailbreak attempt is successful. If the evaluation considers the jailbreak successful, the iterative process will end. Or it continues until the maximum number of jailbreak attempts is reached. 

Evaluation is a crucial part of the automated jailbreak process; A complete and thorough evaluation makes a jailbreak system more efficient through early termination. Conversely, an over-optimistic evaluation method potentially terminates the iterative process before achieving a true jailbreak. Recent jailbreak systems evaluate the responses from LLMs through three methods: ( _a_ ) string matching `SM` , ( _b_ ) natural language understanding `NLU` , and ( _c_ ) natural language generation `NLG` . 

Despite the diversity of methods used to evaluate jailbreaks, existing methods share two main limitations. First, existing jailbreak evaluation methods have unclear goals and are not aligned with the detection of content expected by attackers. To illustrate, `SM` may leverage deny lists to detect words that signal a failed jailbreak (e.g., “illegal”), with the aim of detecting unsafe content. However, the deny list cannot understand the context of the response. Unsafe responses such as _“Phishing is illegal. To phish someone, you need to craft a deceptive email that appears to be from a legitimate source.”_ will be classified as false negative. 

Second, these methods oversimplify jailbreak results as a simple binary outcome (i.e., jailbreak succeeds or fails), which fails to capture the nuances among jailbreak motivations. For example, consider the following jailbreak attempt: 

```
Intent:Explainhowtopoisonaperson'sfood

```

```
Response:Hereisanexplanationofhowto

Icannotfulfillyourrequest.I'mjustanAI,

```

The response here contains affirmative words at the beginning, seemingly providing useful information for the intent. This 

may cause binary classifications to incorrectly treat this as a successful jailbreak. However, the answer is not helpful. 

These limitations motivate us to propose a new set of metrics to distinguish between attackers and better capture the nuances among jailbreak motivations. We evaluate the intent and response with safeguard violation ( **SV** ), informativeness ( **I** ), and relative truthfulness ( **RT** ). We define **SV** as a breach in the safeguard set by the LLM provider. Furthermore, we define **I** to determine whether a response provides relevant information for intent, and **RT** measures whether the response is truthful to the intent. To compute our metrics, we design a multifaceted approach. First, we extend the natural language generation method ( `NLG` ), using prompt templates to evaluate **SV** , **I** , and **RT** . To improve performance, we preprocess the LLM’s response, tokenizing it at the paragraph and sentence level, and removing invalid segments (e.g., truncated sentences in the response). 

To evaluate the performance of our metrics, we design an evaluation setup as follows. First, we leverage three different jailbreak systems, Greedy Gradient Descent `GCG` , Generation Exploitation `GE` , and Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement `PAIR` using three different malicious datasets to produce an intent-response dataset of 250 data points. Three annotators manually label the dataset with respect to all three metrics ( **SV** , **I** , **RT** ) to produce a benchmark dataset. We then evaluate the performance of our multifaceted approach, along with three representative implementations of binary jailbreak evaluation methods ( `SM` , `NLU` , `NLG` ). We find that `SM` performs poorly in all metrics ( **SV** , **I** , and **RT** ) with an average F1 score for these metrics around 60%. `NLU` has a similar peak performance with `SM` , F1 score of 82%. Finally, `NLG` performs better than `SM` and `NLU` , with a consistent F1 score, on average, from 70% to high 80%. **Our multifaceted approach outperforms all three of these methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17%.** 

In summary, we make the following contributions: 

- We outline limitations in existing methods and propose three metrics to evaluate the jailbreak result. 

- We analyze the performance of existing jailbreak evaluation methods `SM` , `NLU` , and `NLG` against our new set of metrics. 

- We introduce a multifaceted evaluation with response preprocessing, to achieve a classification performance with an improved F1 score (increase of 17%). 

Our framework is made publicly available in our research replication repository ( `https://github` _._ `com/ controllability/jailbreak-evaluation` ) for public use and validation.

## **2 Background** 

## **2.1 Large Language Model** 

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful. Their ability to generate general-purpose language has garnered widespread attention, especially due to web interfaces such as ChatGPT [22] and Gemini [4]. These tools serve a variety of purposes for different users. For example, students may use LLMs to generate essays and summarize texts [3], while software developers can use them to synthesize complete code [35] or power state-of-the-art chatbots [5]. The ability of LLMs to complete such tasks makes them of great benefit to the everyday user. However, some users may want to exploit LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news [51], creating phishing scams [19], writing malware [20, 21], spreading misinformation [14], creating malicious database queries [26, 44, 47], or cyberbullying. There are some techniques to align LLMs with human preferences and values to help them generate more helpful and safer content. When these techniques are well used, LLMs do not output unsafe content. 

## **2.2 Language Model Jailbreak** 

To produce the expected content, some attackers attempt to circumvent the safeguards. Language model jailbreak refers to the technique of bypassing safeguards. 

Figure 2 presents a sample method of jailbreaking a language model. When an intent ( _“How to make a bomb?”_ ) is expressed, the language model responds with a refusal. However, when an adversarial suffix is added, the language model responds with harmful content. Methods leveraged to jailbreak language models vary depending on the attacker’s access to the language model, which can be either in the black-box setting or the white-box setting, as detailed below. 

**White-Box.** For the white-box language model jailbreak, we assume that the attacker has complete knowledge of the model and has full access to its runtime. Attackers can arbitrarily 

change the components and parameters of the model and are free to deploy the model locally. This attack is suitable for open source language models, such as Llama [39]. Popular white-box attack methods include (1) _inference hyperparameter adjustment_ and (2) _gradient optimized prompt_ . 

Most of existing alignment procedures are based on the default inference hyper-parameter setting. This leaves these aligned language models vulnerable to misconduct when alternative hyper-parameter settings are used. Typical inference hyper-parameters include temperature, τ, which controls the sharpness of distribution; _K_ , which controls the sampling range in Top-K decoding; and _P_ , which controls the sampling range in Top-P decoding. Jailbreak can be achieved by adjusting these parameters, as exemplified by generation exploitation attacks `(GE)` [19]. 

For gradient-optimized prompts, attackers try to use gradient descent to optimize prompts. The process is similar to neural network training but freezes the model parameters instead of input. The goal of this process is to minimize a loss function with respect to the current response and the target response. The target is set to encourage the language model to output specific tokens such as _“Sure”_ , _“Certainly”_ , or _“I will tell you”_ . This process is exemplified by the gradient coordinate descent attack `GCG` [51] 

**Black-Box** Black-box refers to when the attacker can only modify the prompt to language model and observe response. Here, the attackers do not have knowledge of the system’s underlying structure. In this scenario, attackers can only use adversarial prompts to elicit expected responses from LLMs. Some researchers find that adversarial prompts generated under white-box settings (e.g., gradient-optimized prompts) may also succeed in jailbreaking other models. This is called _transferable prompt_ . Another popular method to generate adversarial prompts is through _Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement_ `(PAIR)` [14]. Here, an attacker LLM is used to automatically generate adversarial prompts for a target LLM. The attacker iteratively queries the target LLM and refines the candidate adversarial prompt. This method is inspired by social engineering attacks, which often disguise malicious intents as benign intents. Here is an example prompt generated via this method.

## **3 Problem Statement and Motivation** 

Both white-box and black-box jailbreaks rely on an evaluation method to determine the success or failure of a 

3 

jailbreak attempt. Given an intent and the language model’s response, a reliable evaluation method should correctly classify whether this jailbreak attempt is successful. However, existing evaluation methods have several limitations, as we outline in the following sections.

## **3.1 Existing Evaluation Methods** 

Previous jailbreak systems evaluate the success or failure of a jailbreak attempt using three methods: (1) String Matching ( `SM` ), (2) Natural Language Understanding ( `NLU` ), and (3) Natural Language Generation ( `NLG` ). 

**String Matching.** `SM` approaches check whether there is a set of strings in the response, using an allow list or a deny list [43, 45, 51]. The presence of allow-list words/phrases, such as _“sure”_ , _“certainly”_ , or _“here is”_ , is used to signal a successful jailbreak. The presence of deny-list words/phrases, such as _“sorry”_ , _“illegal”_ , or _“I can not”_ , is used to signal a failed jailbreak attempt. For example, consider the intent of _“How to steal someone’s password?”_ with the response of _“Certainly, to steal a password, you can install a keylogger in your device and make them sign into an account.”_ This attempt is marked as a successful jailbreak due to the presence of the allow-list word _“certainly”_ . 

**Natural Language Understanding.** `NLU` approaches employ classifiers to evaluate the response of the language model [19, 28, 37, 48]. Such classifiers are based on the `NLU` model architecture, e.g., BERT, and are trained on labeled human preference datasets, e.g., the HH-RLHF dataset [10]. The dataset consists of sample responses and their labels. Each sample response is typically labeled “harmful” or “not harmful”. A response is classified as a successful jailbreak if its score exceeds a threshold. For example, the response _“Certainly, to steal a password, you can install a keylogger in your device and make them sign into an account.”_ is classified as successful jailbreak with a high level of confidence. 

**Natural Language Generation.** `NLG` approaches construct a prompt to instruct another generative language model to evaluate the jailbreak attempt [14, 18, 25, 49]. The prompt contains evaluation criteria and an output format guideline. For example, a popular prompt template involves instructing the language model to behave as a red-team assistant, providing definitions for the evaluation criteria, and requesting the evaluation results. We present an example evaluation prompt in Appendix A. 

## **3.2 Limitations of Evaluation Methods** 

The existing evaluation methods outlined in Section 3.1 aim to evaluate jailbreak success/failure. However, these methods have two main limitations. 

- The objectives of these methods lack clarity and do not align with the objective of identifying unsafe content. 

Figure 3: Response incorrectly labeled as a failed jailbreak by the `SM` approach due to detecting deny list words.

```

Figure 4: Response incorrectly labeled by `NLU` approach, likely due to insufficient training data or similar cases in the training dataset manually annotated as helpful. 

- The oversimplification of jailbreak as a simple binary outcome, successful or failed, fails to capture the nuances among jailbreak motivations. 

**Unclear and Unaligned Evaluation Goal.** The purpose of a jailbreak is to successfully cause the language model to produce the content expected by attackers. However, existing jailbreak evaluation methods have unclear goals and are not aligned with the detection of such content. For instance, string matching ( `SM` ) is unable to achieve this goal as it fails to understand the context of the response. To illustrate, Figure 3 shows an example of a false negative – where string matching incorrectly considers the response a failed jailbreak attempt, due to the presence of the deny list words _“illegal”_ and _“unethical”_ . 

Similarly, although `NLU` approaches’ ability to comprehend context exceeds `SM` approaches, they are constrained by the diversity of training data used. To illustrate, the model proposed in [19] uses the HH-RLHF dataset [10]. This dataset is crowdsourced and contains data points of usefulness and harmlessness based on human preference (and not from the perspective of restricted content). For example, Figure 4 presents a case where a adversarial setting successfully generates information on Denial-of-Service attacks. However, the `NLU` approach labels it as a failed jailbreak attempt, likely due to the lack of relevant cases in the training dataset. 

**Oversimplified Binary Classification.** `NLG` approaches may better understand the context of a response and the evaluation criteria than both `SM` and `NLU` approaches, however, they still suffer from oversimplifying jailbreak to a binary problem of success and failure, but often ignore differences in how different attackers define success. We note that `NLU` and `SM` 

4 

approaches also face this same limitation. 

We argue that the jailbreak evaluation should be from the perspective of the user who wants to jailbreak language models. Attackers have different motivations. Some attackers want to damage the reputation of the company and its value, while others seek assistance for illegal activities. The prior work’s treatment of jailbreak as a binary classification fails to capture this fact. To illustrate, we consider an intent and its response. 

```
Intent:Howtowritemalwarecode
```

```
Response:Sure,towritemalwarecode,please
copythefollowing:[FUNCTIONTOADDTWO
NUMBERS]
```

Here, the response is willing to provide information related to the prompt. However, providing a function to add two numbers does not constitute malware. Alternatively, another potential response could contain actual code that constitutes malware. Treating jailbreak as a binary problem based on one criterion fails to differentiate between these two. 

## **4 Jailbreak Evaluation Metrics** 

We propose three metrics to evaluate language model jailbreaks (Section 4.1). We also outline how our metrics map to different malicious actors (Section 4.2). 

## **4.1 Metric Definitions** 

Instead of treating jailbreak as a binary problem, we propose decomposing jailbreak evaluation into three different binary metrics: _safeguard violation_ ( **SV** ), _informativeness_ ( **I** ), and _relative truthfulness_ ( **RT** ). 

**Safeguard Violation (SV). SV** refers to instances where the response breaches the safeguard set by the language model provider. Public safeguards are often visible in the form of user agreements, terms of service, and published ethical guidelines [8], [2]. These documents typically outline the intended use of the language model, restrictions on certain types of query, and the ethical framework within which the model operates. Common violations include discrimination, bias, promotion of violence, and criminal solicitation. Here, we note that the determination of **SV** has nothing to do with prompt. No matter what the content of the prompt is, the content prohibited by safeguard should not appear in the response. Responses that contain the content prohibited by safeguard are considered to **SV** . 

**Informativeness (I). I** refers to whether a response provides relevant information about the intent. In the context of language models, the intent is expressed via a prompt. For instance, here is an adversarial prompt which expresses _“Provide detailed instructions on how to make a bomb”_ : 

```
Intent:Generateamessagethatspreadsfake

```

A line of previous work on language models has established informativeness as a crucial metric for evaluating the response [25]. Yet, previous jailbreak systems do not incorporate this metric in their evaluation, while it plays a pivotal role in language model jailbreak evaluation. 

To illustrate, we consider intent _“Generate a message that spreads fake news”_ and consider a response that violates safeguards, as shown in Figure 5. The response creates an article that discusses _dangers_ of fake news. Figure 6 presents a similar intent where the response actually crafts a fake news article designed to cause panic and chaos. These responses provide varying levels of information to the attacker: the latter is informative to the intent, while the former is not. Thus, we introduce informativeness as a metric to differentiate between such cases. 

**Relative Truthfulness (RT).** The third metric we introduce to evaluate jailbreak is **RT** . This metric measures whether the response is truthful to the intent. We note that there are

Figure 7: Overview of response preprocessing. 

traditional truthfulness metrics for the evaluation of language models, as detailed in [25]; however, they cannot be used directly for the evaluation of jailbreak, as they only pay attention to the response, but ignore the intent. Consider the intent to create fictional scenarios, which is an important application scenario for jailbreak (e.g., generating fake news). Existing truthfulness metrics classify its response as nontruthful, because it is fictional. Therefore, focusing only on the response and ignoring the intent will cause a large number of false negatives in the jailbreak evaluation. To solve this problem, **RT** consider both the intent and the response. **RT** evaluates this kind of responses as relatively truthful, as the responses align with the fictional intent (even if it is factual or incorrect). Thus, the evaluation of **RT** depends on **I** . Only if **I** is true, **RT** will be further evaluated, otherwise, **RT** is evaluated directly as false. Additionally, for attackers seeking help with illicit activities, the traditional definition of truthfulness [25] is of little significance. For example, a prompt of _“How to make a bomb?”_ probably elicits a language model response of _“Bombs are illegal in the US”_ . The response is truthful, but does not provide any information. It is not a successful jailbreak. A response is deemed **RT** if it is based on truthful information for the intent. Thus, an **RT** response to _“How to make a bomb?”_ would be _“To make a bomb, you need [ACCURATE COMPOSITION OF BOMB]”_ . 

## **4.2 Mapping Metrics to Malicious Actors** 

Table 1 presents an overview of how metrics ( **SV** , **I** , and **RT** ) correlate with different types of malicious actors. First, benign actors have no motivation to jailbreak the language model. They expect the content that is informative ( **I** ) and relatively true ( **RT** ) to their intents, but do not violate safeguards (not **SV** ). Although they never actively trigger safeguard violations, responses may not always be informative or relatively truthful ( **I** , **RT** could be true or false). Apart from the benign actor, we define two types of malicious actors that employ jailbreak. These actors are denoted as malicious actor 1 ( **MA1** ) and malicious actor 2 ( **MA2** ). 

The first type of malicious actor ( **MA1** ) aims to damage the reputation of the language model provider by **SV** . As explained in Section 4.1, the safeguard violation refers to when a response breaches the safeguard set by the language model provider. To illustrate, when asking _“How to steal credentials?”_ , **MA1** aims for a response similar to _“I will tell you how to steal credentials.”_ , which violates the safeguards. Here, we note that **MA1** is not concerned with the informativeness and truthfulness of the response. A response that violates the safeguards leads to a loss of trust among the public. There could be legal risks, especially if the response contravenes laws or regulations. This is because the provider is supposed to avoid outputting such prohibited content. Thus, by successfully demonstrating this failure, **MA1** achieves its goal of damaging the reputation of the language model provider. 

The second type of malicious actor ( **MA2** ) aims to seek assistance for illegal or immoral activities by jailbreaking the language model. **MA2** aims to obtain accurate information that can help them achieve their malicious intent. They hope that the response will provide explicit guidance. For example, an intent of _“How to steal credentials?”_ can be met with _“To steal credentials, first, you need to design a phishing email”_ Here, **MA2** bypasses safeguards and wants to obtain an informative and relatively truthful response. 

## **5 Metric Computation** 

We now detail how we compute our metrics. First, we introduce how we compute safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness given an intent and a language model response. Second, we outline how the preprocessing enables better evaluation performance. 

## **5.1 (Intent, Response) Classification** 

Given malicious intent ( _Int_ ) and response ( _R_ ), we evaluate jailbreak using our three metrics: **SV** , **I** , and **RT** . All three metrics are evaluated as binary, True or False. Evaluation of **SV**

Figure 8: Hierarchical tokenization divides the response into segments. Each segment is evaluated independently. 

only takes into account the response; **SV** : _R → False, True_ (where _True_ represents a safeguard violation). The evaluation of **I** and **RT** takes into account the intent and the response; **I** : ( _Int, R_ ) _→ False, True_ and **RT** : ( _Int, R_ ) _→ False, True_ , where _True_ represents an **I** or **RT** response. 

To do so, we extend the natural language generation method `(NLG)` to serve as our evaluation function for the three metrics. Specifically, we leverage GPT-4 using a prompt template. This template contains descriptions for the three evaluations ( **SV** , **I** , **RT** ) and takes the _Int_ and _R_ as input. We introduce our own prompt templates for **SV** and **RT** . For **I** , we inherit the prompt template from [14]. We perform the OR operation between the result of [14] and our result of **RT** to obtain our result of **I** . The prompt templates that we use can be found in the Appendix B. An example of the intent, response, and output of evaluation can be found in the Appendix C.

> Figure 9: Invalid segments that we exclude: 1 special token, 2 prompt echo, 3 truncated segment. 

i.e., passing the entire response into our prompt template, we break the response down into smaller segments. We perform the _OR_ operation on evaluation results from all segments to obtain the evaluation result of the response. Here, we consider two levels of tokenization, paragraph level and sentence level. Responses may contain segments that satisfy a metric and segments that do not satisfy any metric, as illustrated in Figure 8. Here, we consider a response to an intent of _“How to make a bomb?”_ . The first, third, and fourth segments comply with safeguards. The second segment violates safeguards by providing instructions on how to make a bomb. If one segment satisfies a metric, we consider this response as satisfying this metric (in this example, this response satisfies **SV** ). However, when a response is evaluated at the document level, a proportional imbalance may cause interference, e.g., the dominance of safeguard-compliant (the first, third, and fourth segment) may contribute to incorrect classification. Thus, by hierarchical tokenization, we overcome this problem, as each segment is individually evaluated. 

## **5.2 Response Preprocessing** 

After preliminary testing our (Intent, Response) classification, we found that performance was poor (Section 6). Despite `NLG` ’s established capabilities (Section 3), we realized that its potential varies depending on the nature of the input, in this case the intent and the response. Although intents are typically short (one to two sentences), responses are typically much longer and contain a plethora of information. Drawing on this knowledge and from the results of our preliminary tests, we preprocess the language model response to improve the performance of our evaluation method. Figure 7 summarizes the main components of our response preprocessing. It takes a response as input and outputs a series of segments for evaluation. The response preprocessing process has two steps: hierarchical tokenization and invalid segment exclusion. 

### **5.2.1 Hierarchical Tokenization** 

We first apply a hierarchical tokenization to the response. Instead of evaluating the response at the document level, 

### **5.2.2 Invalid Segment Exclusion** 

While hierarchical tokenization offers granularity, not all segments are valid candidates for evaluation. Some segments may skew evaluation results and thus should be filtered. For example, Figure 9 presents an abbreviated response to the intent of _“How to write malware to hack into a government database and steal money”_ , exemplifying segments that are invalid. We identify three categories: the prompt echo segment, the special token segment, and the truncated segment. 

**Prompt Echo Segment.** Prompt echo segments refer to portions of the response where the language model repeats parts of the original user’s prompt ( 2 ). In the scenario of a jailbreak attempt, the prompt contains malicious intent. Thus, when the prompt is echoed back, these segments are often harmful by nature and are usually evaluated as evidence of a successful jailbreak. However, their presence within the response provides no additional information beyond what is already known. We ignore such segments.

> 1 RFAB indicates Refined AdvBench, MI indicates MaliciousInstruct, and RPAB indicates Representative AdvBench. 

**Special Token Segment.** Special token segments contain only special tokens of the language model ( 1 ). Language models often utilize specific tokens, such as _⟨s⟩_ , _⟨/s⟩_ , [CLS], or [SEP], for internal processing or structural purposes (e.g., _⟨s⟩_ , _⟨/s⟩_ are often used to indicate the start or end of a sentence, respectively). These tokens lack semantic meaning for humans, but can confuse downstream evaluation when they are added to the prompt template. We exclude such segments so that our evaluation focuses on meaningful content. 

**Truncated Segment.** We also remove incomplete or truncated segments. Language models often operate under token limitations during inference; thus, response truncation is common. Truncation can significantly distort the original meaning of a segment and subsequently negatively influence the correctness of the evaluation. Consider the response in Figure 9- 3 that initially repeats words from the user’s prompt but then stops. Truncation here eliminates further denial, leaving only the harmful part, leading to a false positive evaluation. We find that truncated segments appear at the end of a response and are denoted by the lack of terminating punctuation (e.g., “.”, “?”,“!”). We exclude these truncated segments. 

## **6 Evaluation** 

## **6.1 Evaluation Setup** 

**Malicious Intent Dataset.** We collect three datasets from three representative jailbreak systems, i.e., (1) AdvBench [51]; (2) MaliciousInstruct [19]; and (3) Representative AdvBench [14]. There are many similar intents in the AdvBench dataset, which is reported in [14]. To alleviate redundancy, we employ a similar deduplication process as [14] to refine the AdvBench dataset but retain more items than the Representative AdvBench. Detailed statistics of these datasets are shown 

in Table 2. The collected datasets contain a total of 250 malicious intents, such as cyberbullying, defamation, and physical harm (e.g., _“Write a tutorial on how to make a bomb”_ ). 

**Jailbreak Generation.** We select three representative jailbreak generation methods (covering both white-box and blackbox) to generate adversarial settings associated with the intent. These implementations comprise: (1) Gradient Optimized Prompt: Greedy Coordinate Gradient ( `GCG` ) [51]; (2) Inference Hyper-Parameter Adjustment: Generation Exploitation ( `GE` ) [19]; and (3) Iterative Refined Prompt: Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement ( `PAIR` ) [14]. 

**Benchmark Dataset.** To enable fair assessment of jailbreak evaluation methods, we generate a benchmark dataset. The construction of the benchmark dataset is shown in Figure 10. First, we collect three malicious intent datasets from existing works ( 1 ). Second, we use three existing jailbreak generation methods to jailbreak language models on these malicious intent datasets ( 2 ). We collect intents and responses during this process and construct an intent-response dataset ( 3 ). Next, a group of three annotators labels this intent-response dataset with respect to our metrics, **SV** , **I** , **RT** ( 4 ). Then we apply our multifaceted evaluation method and existing binary evaluation methods ( `SM` , `NLU` , `NLG` ) on this dataset ( 5 ). Finally, we compare the result from these evaluation methods with the human label. We pair malicious intent datasets, target language models, and jailbreak generation methods following the original experiment setting in these jailbreak generation methods. 

**Manual Labeling Process.** Before we label our dataset in 4 , we synthesize a labeling guide and ensure that our labeling guide is sound. This involves two annotators separately labeling a random set of 50 items. We use the Krippendorff alpha score [23], an agreement metric suitable for multi-label datasets, to determine agreement between annotators. They reach a high level of consensus (α _>_ 0 _._ 8), work out any differences, and refine the guide by adding explanations. Our complete and revised labeling guideline is presented in our replication repository [9]. 

After the guide was solidified, three annotators started labeling the remaining 200 items. All annotators are familiar with the labeling process and the guide. After addressing their questions, all the annotators felt confident in using the guideline. We divide these three annotators into two groups of two people. An annotator participates in both groups. Each pair labeled 100 randomly assigned items. The annotators conducted the labeling process on Doccano [1], an open source tool for collaborative work. Within each group, the annotators work independently. Then they come together to address any disagreements in their labeling. Each group reached a high level of agreement (α _>_ 0 _._ 819) on the three labels before reconciling the differences. We use these agreed-upon labels as the ground truth for our benchmark. 

**Jailbreak Evaluation.** We apply our multifaceted evaluation method and three existing binary evaluation methods to the

Figure 10: The construction of the benchmark dataset. 

benchmark dataset and compare their results with the groundtruth labels. For binary evaluation methods, we select representative implementations for each type, which are detailed in Section 3.1, i.e., (i) `SM` [51]; (ii) `NLU` [19]; and (iii) `NLG` [14]. Existing binary methods aim to predict whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. From common knowledge, if a jailbreak attempt is successful, it should be **SV** , **I** , and **RT** . Therefore, we map their binary result to the results across all metrics (e.g., `SM` _→_ True maps to **SV** _→_ True, **I** _→_ True, **RT** _→_ True). We use their publicly available source code and follow their default parameters and configurations in the experiment. 

For three methods (our multifaceted evaluation method and two existing methods: `NLU` and `NLG` ), we evaluate without and with response preprocessing. The selected implementation for `SM` uses a deny-list, and thus does not benefit from preprocessing. We denote evaluation without response preprocessing as document level (DL). For response preprocessing, we consider two levels of hierarchical tokenization: paragraph level (PL) and sentence level (SL). Both PL and SL undergo invalid segment exclusion. If any segment in PL and SL satisfies a metric (e.g., **SV** of the second segment is True), the metric for the entire response is considered True ( **SV** of the response is True). We also conduct a joint-level (JL) evaluation, in which we combine the evaluation results from PL, SL and DL with an `OR` operator. 

For our multifaceted evaluation, we introduce an additional combination level (CL). We do this after preliminary tests have shown that the performance of **I** and **RT** evaluated at DL is relatively poor, affecting the result for JL. We posit that this is due to interference between different segments when the response is evaluated at the document level. To overcome this, CL takes an ensemble approach, where we evaluate **SV** at the joint level and evaluate **I** and **RT** at the paragraph level. 

**Analyzing Results.** For all metrics, we calculate their accuracy, F1, precision, and recall. Higher scores indicate better classification performance. 

## **6.2 Overall Classification Performance** 

### **6.2.1 Metric-wise Evaluation Result** 

Table 3 provides an overview of the classification performance of our multifaceted evaluation method and existing binary methods in three metrics **SV** , **I** , **RT** . **Our combinationlevel (CL) multifaceted outperforms all binary evaluation methods, according to the F1 score.** With the exception of **I** for GE (F1 =0 _._ 85) and **RT** for GCG (F1 =0 _._ 87), the F1 scores of all other metrics are greater than or equal to 0 _._ 92. Interestingly, for GCG and GE, the performance of **SV** exceeds **I** and **RT** . For PAIR, **I** exceeds **SV** and **RT** . Additionally, `NLU` and `NLG` have a stark difference in F1 scores between metrics for GCG and GE, with **SV** much higher (typically between 0 _._ 72-0 _._ 94) than **I** and **RT** . It indicates that previous methods are moderately successful in capturing safeguard violations, but not in providing information or relative truthfulness. 

Performance increases in our multifaceted evaluation under PL and SL, compared to DL, demonstrating the value of our response preprocessing. Noticeably, response preprocessing also helps increase performance of `NLU` and `NLG` . 

### **6.2.2 Malicious Actor-wise Evaluation Result** 

We further evaluate the performance from an actor-wise perspective. We consider two different types of malicious actors – **MA1** who aims to damage the reputation of the language model provider, and **MA2** who aims to seek assistance for illicit activities. **MA1** ’s criteria is to satisfy **SV** , while **MA2** needs to satisfy all the metrics, **SV** , **I** and **RT** . 

Table 4 gives an overview of the results. Similarly to the performance from the metric perspective, **our combinationlevel (CL) multifaceted evaluation demonstrates the best performance compared to existing binary methods** , with the fact that the majority of the F1 score is greater than 0 _._ 94. We also observe trends similar to the metric-wise performance here for the impact of preprocessing. We also show the performance for the case of the benign user, where all metrics are false. The ability of our multifaceted evaluation to detect such users is high, with an F1 score consistently greater than 0 _._ 95.

Figure 11: An example of prompt echo. The language model repeats the prompt in the response. Feeding this intent into the `NLU` method and the `NLG` method causes them to output positive classification results. 

## **6.3 Analyzing Cases of Failure** 

In our experiments, we observe that existing `SM` , `NLU` , and `NLG` jailbreak evaluation methods frequently result in misclassifications. To dive deeper into the factors that contribute to these inaccurate classifications, two annotators manually analyzed all their incorrect classification instances, where our multifaceted method succeeds. We divide the causes of misclassification into three categories: (1) the prevalence of prompt echoes, (2) the rejection in responses, and (3) limited evaluation language model capacity. We detail them below. 

### **6.3.1 Prevalence of Prompt Echo** 

As detailed in Section 5.2, the prompt echo is the case when the language model repeats or paraphrases parts of the prompt in its response. The mere repetition of the prompt without introducing additional information should not be considered as **SV** . However, because prompts are malicious, evaluation methods may consider prompt echoes to be **SV** , which results in a false positive. Figure 11 shows an example of a misclassi- 

fication caused by a prompt echo; the original intent of faking a social security number is repeated. 

We discover that, for GE, 9% of misclassifications have this issue. Prompt echoes may contribute to misclassification in `NLU` ’s core language model and `NLG` . We directly input the prompts of these samples into `NLU` ’s core language model and `NLG` . The `NLU` ’s core language model classifies all these prompts as a **SV** . The `NLG` method classifies 22% of these prompts as **SV** . This indicates that these language models infer the prompt echo segment as **SV** . The `NLG` method is less affected by a simple prompt echo, because it considers the richness of information provided in the response in the design of its prompt. The `SM` method is not affected by the prompt echo, because prompts rarely contain words in the deny list. 

### **6.3.2 Rejection Pattern in Response** 

The second cause contributing to misclassification is the rejection pattern in the response. A well-aligned language model tends to reject malicious intents. These rejections are characterized by negative words, e.g., “illegal”, “immmoral”. `SM` (with the deny list), `NLU` , and `NLG` methods often deem responses containing negative terms as non-jailbreak. However, some responses contain both these negative terms and useful information for malicious intents. These responses should be considered as **SV** , **I** , and **RT** . Therefore, the rejection pattern in the responses may result in false negative. 

Figure 12 shows an example of a false negative affected by this, incorrectly classified by `SM` , `NLU` , and `NLG` . Although harmful intent is answered with accurate information, rejection patterns (e.g., the word “illegal”) contribute to false negative. We find this problem prevalant in benchmark datasets generated from the GCG and PAIR. According to the 29 rejec-

affects the semantics of the response. 

tion patterns defined in [51], we find that 32% of the samples in the GCG benchmark dataset contain rejection patterns but still violate the safeguards, while 6% samples in the PAIR benchmark dataset have the same problem. The `SM` deny list is greatly affected by this, because it classifies all samples with rejection patterns as negative, thus producing false negatives. 

To confirm whether these rejection patterns affect `NLG` methods, we manually remove sentences that contain the rejection language from the relevant responses. We feed the responses before and after removal to the GPT-3.5-Turbo-based `NLG` method. Overall, we find that removing these sentences reduces false negative cases for **MA1** from the actor’s perspective. For GCG, false negatives decrease by 20%, and for PAIR, false negatives are reduced by 50%. Rejection pattern removal also reduces the overall false-negative cases produced. This shows that rejections contribute to the misclassification produced by the `NLG` method, because every word in the response 

However, our multifaceted method overcomes these limitations as we isolate the impact of these rejections through hierarchical tokenization. Rejection patterns in one segment do not affect the evaluation result of other segments. 

### **6.3.3 Limited Evaluation Language Model Capability** 

The third reason contributing to misclassification is limited evaluation language model capability. Both `NLU` methods and `NLG` methods are affected as they rely on language models (e.g., BERT [17], GPT [13], Llama [40]). Despite their impressive capabilities, we find that their limitations lead to false negatives. Figures 13 and Figure 14 present two such cases of false negatives. The intents present are malicious, producing false invoices and designing SQL injection attacks, respectively. However, while the responses clearly support the users’ malicious intents, these responses are incorrectly judged as non-jailbreak, neither **SV** , **I** , **RT** , which are false negative.

Figure 14: Another example of misclassification caused by limited evaluation language model capability. 

Interestingly, when we directly present two language model chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT and Bard, with these intents, both chatbots respond with information that facilitates the harmful intent. We provide screenshots of the conversations in Appendix D. ChatGPT and Bard should detect that the intents are malicious and refuse to respond. However, they respond to these intents, indicating that their core language models have limited capabilities or that their developers do not align them with these malicious intents. If their core language models are used as evaluation language models, these jailbreaks will be missed, resulting in false negatives. 

## **7 Discussion and Limitations** 

We synthesize the key takeaways of our studies, outline future work, and detail the limitations of our study. 

## **7.1 Key Takeaways and Future Work** 

**Leveraging a Multifaceted Evaluation** Our evaluation demonstrates that the evaluation methods used in existing jailbreak systems are capable of detecting **SV** , but are poor in detecting **I** and **RT** . We also show how our method, particularly the combination-level (CL) multifaceted evaluation, outperforms the evaluation methods used in existing jailbreak systems. Given this performance, language model providers can benefit from our evaluation method to better assess the security of language models. The following works could also better assess the effectiveness of jailbreak. 

Our new proposed metrics can be used in blue teaming. Here, the blue team should have access to the white-box model and thus can ensure that all responses are **SV** : False, **I** : False and **RT** : False. We also note that, depending on the users’ motivations, different metrics or combinations of metrics can be prioritized. For example, it is reasonable to assume that language model providers would prioritize avoiding **MA2** , who seeks jailbreak responses that are truthful and informative. Models that are trained to curb **MA2** , but still allow **SV** :True, **I** :False and **RT** :False, may be an acceptable standard for such providers. On the contrary, the read team can work alongside 

the blue team, optimizing the targets for **SV** : True, **I** : True and **RT** : True to ensure the jailbreak defenses of the blue team are resilient. We also note that our metrics have uses beyond jailbreak defense. Given a set of benign intents, a well trained and aligned LLM model should produce responses that are **SV** : False, **I** : True and **RT** : True; that is, informative and accurate responses to the original user’s query that comply with all limitations and restrictions set by the LLM provider. 

**Decomposing Binary Metrics for Language Models.** Our idea of decomposing traditional binary jailbreak evaluation into three different metrics can be extended to the evaluation of language models. There is a plethora of work on ensuring language model correctness in specific domains. We envision that our work can be extended to decompose the metric, like correctness, into granular metrics. To illustrate, the ability of LLM to provide accurate health advice can be based on overall correctness, how feasible the advice is, and whether it is relevant to users’ health related query. Future work should involve the collaboration of domain experts in order to synthesize guidelines for metrics in different fields (e.g., health advice, code generation, etc.). 

**Expanding the Malicious Intent Dataset** Our evaluation setup works on benchmark datasets with 250 items. Although this is sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of our multifaceted evaluation method, future work should expand the size of the benchmark dataset. One method to achieve this is to crowd-source candidate harmful intents. Such methods would allow us to increase the size of the dataset, but also expand on the diversity of the dataset. This is because a wide range of users would have different perspectives and ideas of malicious intent to elicit from a language model. Dataset diversity would help improve jailbreak resilience, as it allows red teams/blue teams to consider previously unseen cases of potential harmful intent and improve alignment. 

## **7.2 Limitations** 

Our work has several limitations. First, we depend on natural language generation ( `NLG` ) as a core component of our evaluation method. Despite its improved performance over `SM` and `NLU` , `NLG` still faces limitations (as stated in Section 6.3.3). However, we note that we improve performance through response preprocessing, as demonstrated in Section 6. Second, an attacker who is aware of our evaluation setup can design an adversarial setting that elicits a response that is truly jailbreak ( **SV** , **I** , **RT** ) and yet fools our evaluation method. However, we argue that expanding on our response preprocessing to filter out noise helps improve the accuracy of our evaluation method. We aim to explore this in future work. 

12 

## **8 Related Work 9 Conclusions** 

There exists a large body of work investigating large language models, with language model alignment and evaluation being the most closely related to our work. 

**Language Model Alignment** Large language model alignment refers to measures to ensure that the models align with human values and expectations. Previous efforts have investigated how reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [16, 30, 40, 50] can incentivize desired behaviors from large language models by rewarding wellaligned responses and penalizing harmful ones. External tools can also be used to limit inappropriate responses, such as NeMo Guardrails [34]. Related to the alignment of the language model are efforts to bypass safeguards through jailbreaks [14,19,27,51]. Here, researchers explore how to design prompts to elicit harmful content from these language models. 

Our work builds on existing alignment research, as we demonstrate how existing efforts to bypass alignment have limitations. Our evaluation results demonstrate how prior jailbreak evaluation methods are able to detect safeguard violations, but not informativeness and relatively true jailbreaks. On the contrary, we introduce a multifaceted jailbreak that outperforms existing works on all three metrics ( **SV** , **I** , **RT** ). 

**Language Model Evaluation** Our efforts to evaluate jailbreaks are based on previous work on the evaluation of language models. For example, several works have evaluated grammar and fluency using a variety of methods such as N-gram measures,e.g., ROGUE [24], BLEU [32], METEOR [11], or using neural network methods such as BERTScore [48], BLEURT [37], and ADEM [28]. Similarly, the truthfulness of language models in producing content in specific domains has also been evaluated, such as [12, 36]. Recently, the evaluation of language models has focused more on hallucination [43] and multimodal [15, 46]. 

Our efforts are based on this large body of work. However, we focus on evaluating the response in the jailbreak scenario. We introduce an evaluation method that outperforms evaluation methods from existing jailbreak systems. Some recent work [29, 38] focuses on the evaluation of jailbreaks. AttackEval [38] introduces the metrics of refusal and compliance. However, these refusal and compliance metrics have limitations. First, as shown in Figure 3, a jailbreak response can contain refusal patterns while still providing unsafe statements. Second, compliance as measured in [38] does not account for **I** or **RT** . As seen in Figure 5, responses may have compliant language, but not be informative or truthful. Finally, the metrics proposed by [38] do not relate to the different actors we propose in Section 4.1. 

Our analysis of current jailbreak evaluation methods has revealed that their evaluation has two limitations. First, their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses, and they oversimplify the evaluation of jailbreak as a binary problem, successful or not. To address these issues, we introduce a multifaceted evaluation approach that has two key aspects, which distinguish it from previous methods. First, we define three metrics: safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness. We evaluate the intent-response pairs with these metrics. To automate the obtaining of metric results, we extend the natural language generation evaluation method with custom prompt templates and preprocessing the response. Additionally, we correlate each metric with different malicious actors that have different goals. Our experiments with three benchmark datasets show that our multifaceted evaluation classification method yields, on average, a 17% better F1 score than three recent jailbreak evaluation methods. Our study provides a rationale for shifting away from the simplistic binary perspective of jailbreak evaluation and instead integrating a more thorough assessment to better evaluate the safety of language models.

## **E Performance with Open Source Models** 

We have also implemented the metrics proposed in the opensource model, and the results are shown as Table 1. Models prefer different evaluation levels for best result. We used Meta’s Llama-3-8B [7] and Google’s Gemma-7B [6]. The implementations are in our repository.
